**Talk to a Subreddit** is an AI chatbot that lets you talk to any subreddits on Reddit with its own unique personality. Powered by **BERT** and **deep learning**, using the Seq2Seq model with the help of Google Tensorflow.

The bot primarily learns from Reddit's posts and comments. This large dataset comes from different subreddits; our goal is to not only closely model the way redditors talk, but also give out unnecessary advices to geeks and nerds on the internet.
