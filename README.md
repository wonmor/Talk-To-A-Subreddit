**HeyBuddy** is an therapy AI chatbot that heals you. Powered by **deep learning**, using the Seq2Seq model with the help of Google Tensorflow.

The bot primarily learns from Reddit's posts and comments. This large dataset comes from different mental health subreddits; our goal is to not only make it converse naturally like a real human being, but also give out practical advices to everyday people.
