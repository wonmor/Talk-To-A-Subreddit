This is not an intuitive meaning of 'initiative' to many autistic people but that's what it tends to mean from a neurotypical employer's perspective.\n\nWhen they say 'initiative' I think they understand it a bit differently to how we are inclined to understand it because they think about jobs a bit differently to us.\n\nFrom our perspective you are given a job role you are paid to do, you do your best to perform in that role, and 'initiative' is where you go the extra mile within your job role capacity.\n\nFrom an NT employer perspective the job role is just one part of how they appraise you; they don't focus in on you as an individual and appraise you impartially, they see you as one part of a greater whole; a member of a team working together to ensure the smooth operation of an organisation and advance its overall interests. So they think about you in terms of your role within the team, which is partly to do with your actual job role but also partly to do with your social role. So that means having to participate socially in order to develop a social role, and to do things like build rapport in order to contribute to the 'team spirit'. They do not make this explicit because they think it's so obvious that they should not have to state it outright.\n\nSo the way they think about it they're not asking you to 'gossip' but they are instead looking for signs that you are building rapport and contributing to the 'team spirit' of the workplace by having some kind of social role (frankly for many people that *does* mean gossiping but that's only understood as incidental, and they will probably respond with incredulity if you ask if that does implicitly mean you are expected to gossip). Usually there are ways for us as autistic people to gain acceptance and some kind of social role, but we have to approach it a bit differently in a way that plays on our unique strengths. If we try to do things in the same way as others it usually doesn't work out great.\n\nWithout knowing more about you or your company, my top tip is simply to bring snacks to work to share. I know that probably sounds completely asinine, and obviously isn't something you should *have* to do, in my experience it's honestly a relatively easy and effective way to get people to start to notice that you are making an active effort socially."", 'Practically, ask in meetings or email if anyone needs help with anything else.

I thought since I was considered pretty social, articulate, and very over achieving, no way I was autistic.

Maybe make a \'Kid Kit\' like the babysitters club did lol (just a box full of puzzles,games, toys, etc that were yours/that you thrifted/ got donated/ etc, just some new and interesting stuff for kids to do); and make \'lesson plans\'/\'day plans\' for each time you sit (ex.- 12pm lunch, 12:30 STEM play, 1:00 diaper changes and clean up, 1:30 walk around block,. 2:00 pre-nap routine (change/bottle/ burp/white noise/storytime), 2:30 nap, 3:30 snack, 3:45 outdoor play (even with a baby, you can walk around the yard and narrate- ""Oooh, see the tree? That\'s a tree, a lovely green tree! Ooh, see the squirrel? Watch him jump!""- you know, just expanding their knowledge and vocab;4:00 Music and Movement (sing songs and rhymes with corresponding movement, such as clapping the babys hands or gently bouncing them; or adjust the activity up thru any age group by researching online); 4:30 cleanup and free play; 5:15 half hour of screen time (Disney movie or smth to calm everyone down if parents allow), and discuss with kiddo how the day went (""Did you have a good day?"" -""what was your fave part?

Since I‚Äôm not a huge fan of the spin-offs, I haven‚Äôt really paid attention to them or their release dates, but it surprised me that it was so early!\n\nI had a good time watching the episode.  Terry Crews and Olivia Munn had some great chemistry on screen.  The villain reveal was extremely predictable, but besides that, the visuals were nice, their relationship developed nicely, and there was even a cute lamb.  However, this was what I feared.  The whole point of this series is for all of them to be one-off episodes of individual survivor stories.  I‚Äôll probably never see Joe and Evie again for at least a few weeks, if they show everyone in the finale.  If not, then they‚Äôll probably show up in spinoff #6482638, on some mission with quirky characters from other spin-offs.  I‚Äôll never get to see their dynamic again, which I find sad.  I fear this will make me uninterested in future episodes if I continue watching because it‚Äôs just going to be the same thing over and over.

Neurotypical and neurodiverse. I think fixating on what we will never be is a path towards the worst of suffering, the deepest turmoil. Its better to work to your strengths and to appreciate the things that make us unique: how they might contribute to the meaning of our lives and how others might benefit from those traits.\n\nStill, what things about neurotypicality leave us, the mildly autistic, on the outside of things, alone. At the same time how can we stitch together tactics to limit the impact these deficits have on us?\n\nI can only speak for myself, but I feel as though I\'ve introspected and soul-searched enough to pin down the starkest difference between me and others in the domain of social-communication: Feeling body language.\n\nThe primary difference between autistics and allistics within social-communication is that, by some twist of evolutionary fate, autistic people lack the neurobiological circuitry to *feel* body language. Or rather feel it in the same way as neurotypical people do.\n\nIn neurotypical people, body language causes a cascade of sensory feelings and emotions in the person receiving them. These sensations and emotions then cause an ingrained emotion-urge that they feel compelled to do. Like salivating at the smell of food or squinting your eyes at bright sunlight or recoiling from the touch of a hot surface. There are more complex sets of social behaviors which are then built from this basic interplay of body space, movement, and location that neurotypicals can consciously intuit and control.  Some examples of the basic: leaning in when interested, being close to people you like, mirroring body language, preening gestures, body positioning, certain eye movements (looking at people you like/ for their reactions or responses), the utter panoply of micro-expressions within the human face.\n\nWe, the autistic, don\'t have these basic responses coded into us, even to the very basic level. For example, flat affect -- the inability to emote through facial movement -- afflicts many, many autistic people and, overall -- though I haven\'t the research to move this beyond anectdotal -- we have much less expressive faces. This is the reason we are often misread as upset, angry, sad, disinterested, bored, haughty, arrogant, at our baseline facial position. Uniform micro-expressions have been found throughout all human cultures, meaning that, at base, these small reactions most people have in facial movement is shared at a biological level by the whole species. Save for us, of course.\n\nMore damagingly, the natural body language of the autistic reads poorly translated into the allistic.\n\nOne aspect I have been wrangling with as of late, for example, is body positioning. Sensory issues can stymie the base language of body positioning (closer = comfort, farther = discomfort). I can literally feel people\'s heat and energy without even touching them, from a space most people would find comfortable. My ingrained response to someone stepping closer to me is to step away from them an equal distance. This communicates discomfort and distaste. Other autistic people who lack that particular sensory discomfort can move too far in the opposite direction. They break boundaries by constantly being too close. Subsequently, I find often that people think I dislike them, or that I want to be left alone, or that I\'m simply not interested in others. This is not even including the issues this causes in deepening relationships. Further, this is just one aspect of our social-communication in which we are misinterpreted -- do not get me started on prosody -- though a fairly big one.\n\nYou start to see the larger issue: Autistic people communicate disinterest and dislike in every aspect of our social-communication behaviors.\n\nIt is not that people don\'t want us -- at least all the time -- it\'s that they think we don\'t want them. Or, worse, that we are completely absorbed in ourselves -- blind to the outside world.  Autistic people can find themselves completely alone save for the people who know them so well they can read their body language (i.e. family and childhood friends).But, at the same time(this is where we get to the actual topic of the post, sorry) those of us who do adapt and learn the basic neurotypical body language from media and observation and even therapy, might still find ourselves floating at the edge of social groups, never really a part of anything.  The deficit doesn\'t go away with the knowledge of the basic language because people aren\'t speaking the basic language; they\'re building much more complex behaviors that are also socio-culturally contingent from  the basic language.  It\'s like knowing the English alphabet and a spit of words without knowing the grammar -- you may start a conversation with the correct phrases, but your disfluency becomes readily clear within a few seconds. We, the lucky few that attain entry into neurotypical society at all, find ourselves unable to deepen relationships, excluded, at the edge, uncared for, scapegoated, and, just unfulfilled, malnourished, starving for connection.\n\nI digress. The next question is how do we circumvent these things so that we can actually find inclusion?\n\nIf you can, project interest. Smile at people, get closer to them than you\'re usually comfortable with, touch them, when you like what someone says lean in, face them when they speak with you, don\'t just make incidental eye contact but appear as if you\'re looking for it, laugh at what they say, mirror their body position. Put as many of the building blocks together in the order you think they go whenever you can for however long you can. Don\'t doubt your position with people until they give verbal confirmation of that precarity, or their body language so overwhelmingly projects dislike that even you are not blind to it. This means purposefully avoiding contact with you, refusing to mirror facial expressions, refusing greetings, turning completely away from you.  If you find yourself on the outside of something, revel in the freedom it gives you, the mystery it bequeaths, and the versatility of your personality.\n\nIf you can\'t, rely on what we do have. Be verbally open in your feelings. I straight up tell people I like them,  I compliment them(careful with this if you\'re fem-presenting) I express my gratitude and my awe at times. If you think you\'ve done something to upset someone, doubt your position with them -- again, avoid this unless there\'s hard evidence -- or feel excluded, talk to them. Don\'t beat around the bush, it makes you look insecure and needy. ""I\'ve been feeling this odd vibe, are we okay?"" ""I consider you a good friend, does that go both ways?"" ""I\'m attracted to you/want to deepen this relationship, what do you think about that?"" Check in with people you trust and have deep relationships with to see if you\'re fucking anything up with the people around you\n\nFinally where are our strengths?\n\nLinguistic and artistic; we just fucking rock at these things in general. I find I communicate much more effectively than most of my neurotypical compatriots if I follow my own rules. I find autistic people express themselves most fully and usually at an insane level of skill artistically.\n\nWe are not caught up in appearances and social status. Can\'t tell you how many times friends of mine were all about a person and I noticed some behaviors that struck me as incongruous or shady only for that person to turn out to be not cool. Even moreso, when people are caught up in some hierarchy or social situation and they become blind to the obvious. Seeing reality is much easier if you\'re not overwhelmed by social signals that seem to act on reality itself.\n\nWe bond deeply and our loyalty tends to be lifelong. When we do bond with someone it is true. We do not discard it easily. Everyone I call a friend knows I would die for them in a heartbeat. They don\'t question it because they know who I am and what a friend truly means to me. We rarely manipulate. Because we usually can\'t. A notable exception is the PDA profile of ASD(ahem, me)  which does actually include a fair bit of manipulation. this means those who trust us, tend to trust us completely. When I say a thing it is believed and that is a boon that has, at times, literally saved my life.\n\nThere is so much more, but I\'ve gone on too long as it is. My final thoughts:\n\nLove who you are because you can be nothing else. Eventually, come to want nothing else but to be that person. Accept your weaknesses; use them to build bridges creatively. There are friends everywhere; you need only find them.  Despair only at the end of all things, otherwise you\'re just making yourself miserable.', 'I think that most people can tell that something is off about me but I‚Äôm also a very feminine gay man and people don‚Äôt associate femininity with autism so the response I usually get is ‚Äúwoah you‚Äôre so much more polite/good at listening then (insert cisgender heterosexual autistic man)‚Äù.', 'Yeah it just feels like whatever you do, there will always be something that others consider ""off"". Like if you ask them what you\'re doing wrong, they\'ll say ""nothing, you do everything well"". But at the same time they\'ll keep on ignoring you, rejecting you and just treating you in a very different way altogether (compared to how they treat other people). Idk if I\'d say this is for a lifetime tho, one just needs to get lucky and find their people.', 'the Uncanny Valley of neurotypes?', ""I think it is. \n\nI am 30 and I am doing great professionally, to the point that I pretty much have 3-4 job offers ready whenever I feel like leaving my current position (which I do love so I'm not looking).

It has gotten increasingly lonely.\n\nBut when I go out with girls, because of my Asperger's and all the issues I had growing up, I lack confidence.

It is lonely and rough."", 'Hey dude, I turned 30 a month ago, and I genuinely believe things do not have to be permanently the way you\'re describing. \n\nHigh functioning Aspergers, the type you\'re describing as mild Aspergers, same difference in my mind, is a real social gray area where you\'re functional enough to take care of yourself, but inept enough to just not ""get social cues"" and as a result, make enough faux pas to not get invited to the next social outing.\n\nDefinitely in high school and early college I noticed this ineptitude on my social skills really impacting my potential friendships, after being super depressed up until my 20th birthday, I spent literally the next five years (2012 to 2017) to try to get myself into a spot I was happy with myself.\n\nI\'ll say, controversially of course, the only way I could accomplish this is through developing various coping mechanisms and tactics to adapt to my situation and learn from my mistakes.\n\nI\'m not perfect by any means, but my biggest asset was just not oversharing or being an asshole know-it-all type of person, and to bite my tongue whenever possible. Then it was developing my active listening skills and actually correctly understanding what people around me were trying to communicate to me or in-between the lines. \n\nIn relationships my issues always involved not understanding when to make the next move or when to stop and go move on. I just didn\'t get how, neurotypical women communicated whether they liked me or not, or whether they wanted me to go further, or whether I was imagining attraction that didn\'t exist. I still struggle with this despite having had a couple girlfriends and gone on dates with several girls. \n\nIn a brief summary, when it came to dating, the cliche of a woman who likes a man of intrigue (like James Bond) was more true than a woman who listened to the thought vomit of an angst ridden insecure person. Another way to phrase this, in dating, I learned from trial and error what was necessary to share versus what I could omit for the sake of leaving up the details to the girl\'s imagination. I learned if a date is actually interested in me, she\'ll ask follow up questions to the bread crumbs I talked about but didn\'t necessarily elaborate on. As far as all are concerned, if you\'re not asked, there\'s really no benefit to share information about yourself that paints you in a depressing light. This is different from bottling up sad news and putting on a false front; you share information with people on a need to know basis, or with trusted friends and family, not with people you\'ve just met or people you\'re just starting to date. That information comes up after some time learning who the other person is first, and how they process information, and the best delivery to communicate that information to them.\n\nAnother way to think of this, I personally do not care about how clean my room is; but I know other people care and recoil in disgust when they see the conditions I live in. I try to avoid inviting people over to see my room, but when they insist, I don\'t say no anymore, I just take the time to clean and organize my room to be presentable for my friends and compromise because I know cleaning my room to appease my friends isn\'t the end of the world, and in fact, is something I should be doing anyway regardless if I don\'t personally care about how clean my room is; this same general mindset exists with a bunch of my idiosyncrasies; I adapt them or tone them down a bit for a given audience, while simultaneously acknowledging their existence and pointing out my mindset / attitude towards the topic, whether it be cleaning, oversharing, having obscure interests, or everything in-between.\n\nI\'m not and I don\'t think I will ever be against the concept of partial-masking; I know the popular belief system claims to ""just be yourself"" and to not mask, but I\'ve found from experience that that\'s terrible advice, especially when your current self is depressed or anxiety ridden, it\'s paramount to do or act out less of the things that fuel your depression, and try to do more of the things that alleviate suffering. If I have a choice between being my true self and a depressed wreck, or a hybrid-masked version of myself with solid friends and decent life prospects and NOT depressed, I\'ll choose the latter as a reasonable compromise. I don\'t want to be myself, and subsequently be a hermit on a rock not leaving my house and sleeping all day because I\'m depressed, I actually want to live life and learn from other people, and sometimes that means dialing back my own idiosyncrasies so the group doesn\'t gang up on me or worse, kick me out of the tribe altogether. Hybrid-Masking and biting my tongue occasionally to have friends is a better fate for me than being my ""true self"" and having no friends.\n\nAnyway, just a few thoughts from an internet stranger.

After nearly 5 years I\'m still coming to terms with new aspects of his personality that aren\'t him,  they are aspergers. 95% of our worst fights and bad days are over me saying something that requires taking context into account & him interpreting it 100% literally. Yesterday I was in my room and I heard banging on the wall.  I went  & asked if he ""hammered something or whatever?"" He said no.  Then I had to ask a bunch of questions in order to get him to say ""well I drilled a screw in the wall.  You asked me if I hammered.  I didn\'t use a hammer"". I said ""or whatever..."" meaning ""or another tool""  but that didn\'t register to him.  He heard hammer & that\'s the end of it.  That kind of stuff happens ALL THE TIME. And it seems like nbd but it is SO DRAINING and destructive to our relationship. This one small trait of needing nearly 100% literal communication is enough to break a relationship.  I love him enough to work my hardest on not taking things personally when he doesn\'t ask questions & says ""if you want me to know you\'d just tell me.  It\'s not my style to pry."" Or when he finishes a conversation by turning his back and walking away from me while im still in the middle of a thought.  Or any of the other things he does/ says that aren\'t NT. He is a genius,  he\'s funny as hell,  he\'s worth fighting for.  But I won\'t lie,  most days he is unhappy & moody & he has a very pessimistic perspective.  There\'s nothing in his life that accounts for the incredibly negative perspective he has most of the time. I see him struggle every day.  But when things are good and calm,  he has the best life & takes advantage of it. \n\nI don\'t think you are doomed to suffer any more than any other human is.  It all comes down to choosing to let go of negative patterns,  surrounding yourself with supportive people,  and leaning into what you\'re doing right in this life.

I personally feel the obstacles that come with being mildly autistic can be dealt with. We don\'t have to suffer with loneliness (well, not all the time anyway. Some degree of loneliness is inevitable; that\'s just the human condition.)\n\n> Most people you meet will treat you very slightly differently, in ways that seem innocuous but which over time add up to massively change the direction of your life for the worse. \n\nSure, people might treat us a little differently because we are a little different. But ""differently"" does not necessarily mean ""worse"". I choose to see it as people trying to adapt their ways to of communication to us, because I believe this is true in most cases. Most people are good or neutral. There will be some assholes see our different-ness as a target for bullying. To deal with those types, do your best to ignore/avoid them, and focus on living as positive a life as possible, surround yourself with good people.\n\nAnother tip i can give is to gain respect and social capital, those will act as buffers and deterrents to any bullies around you. For example, if your friend group is made of students/schoolmates, you can gain social capital by being the smart one who always helps people with assignments and reminds people of upcoming deadlines. If your friend group is made of coworkers, maybe bring snacks to share in the breakroom, try to give your coworkers genuine praise in front of your boss to make them look good. You can gain social capital by being the snack-bringer for a friend group, or you can bring other things too like drinks, weed, playing cards, whatever. It really depends on what the group is into, and what is appropriate (obviously dont bring weed or drinks to work). Or if you live in a decent place that\'s central to everyone in the group, you can gain social capital by being the one who hosts group hangouts at your place.\n\nBasically, building social capital is super helpful, and you can achieve this by being useful to the group. Don\'t be too over-the-top about it though. Rather, just lay back and be observant, and step up when the opportunity arises.\n\nMost importantly, bring positive energy to the group, people like that a lot. I aim to exude an air of calmness, kindness, patience, and competence. You can decide what kind of energy suits you. In group settings, masking in this way is essential; i only fully unmask in one on one settings with people that i\'m much closer to.\n\nBe mindful that masking takes energy, therefore avoid large group social settings if you know you won\'t have the energy to keep up the mask. Or just try to be more laidback so as to not draw too much attention if you have to be in a group setting with low energy.\n\nHate masking? Well, it\'s a skill that we need to hone, that\'s the plain reality of it. Being successful in group settings opens the door for you to be able to get close to other individuals within the group, where you can form lasting one-on-one friendships where you gradually unmask and be more authentically yourself. These will be more fulfilling and intimate social connections. I am lucky to have 2 friends in my life who are very close to me in this way that i can fully trust, and i can unmask and be myself around them. They keep me out of the worst depths of loneliness. But in order to get to this point, i did put in a lot of work into all the stuff i mentioned earlier. Gain social capital, put yourself out there in friend groups in order to be visible and approachable.\n\nYou can meet new people by finding hobby groups. Work on bringing good vibes to the people around you, and try to form personal connections over time. It\'s a numbers game, eventually you\'ll find ""your people"" whom you can form close relationships with.\n\n> You\'ll be ignored, mocked, overruled and rejected for things without any obvious explanation. You\'ll seem to have a very limited ability to make friends or have control over your social life. Sometimes it can be so subtle that you wonder if you\'re imagining it or if the same thing happens to everyone else. (These examples are from my life as you may have guessed.)\n\n\nThese are all issues that come from our lack of innate ability to grasp social cues. Fortunately, we can make up for it with cognitive ability. I was quite the outcast up til my early teens because i didnt understand or care about a lot of social cues or context clues. But I started to cognitively brute-force-learn social cues from any source of information i could get my hands on: youtube videos, overhearing conversations, watching people\'s body language, tv shows and movies, books, etc.\n\nI even sometimes ""interrogate"" my closest friends about what certain social cues in certain situations mean, because i know i can trust them and they won\'t judge me for asking. Everything is a valuable extra data point.\n\nCognitively brute-forcing social cues and interactions can be a bit overwhelming at first, but as you get used to it, it becomes second nature. Now i have a pretty easy time with it, though it still does require a decent amount of mental energy to keep up.\n\nWhich brings me to the next important point: be mindful of your energy level. Recharge when you need to, and dont overstrain yourself because thats when you slip up and ""act too different"" and get misunderstood. Clarity is king; always maximise your chances of being properly and fully understood (cus isnt that what we all want: to be fully understood?)\n\n> Despite years of masking and trying to figure people out and improve my social skills, it\'s like Im stuck in this purgatory that I can never escape from.\n\nI understand. I still feel that way sometimes. But we have to let go of the idea of ""escaping"" the purgatory, because we will always have to put in effort to socially function. It will never be effortless, and that\'s okay. Life takes work, happiness takes work, regardless of whether we\'re NT or ND. Embrace the work, overcome everything, and cultivate happiness however you can.\n\nThere are still times when i feel frustrated, desperate, lonely, disappointed, misunderstood, betrayed, overworked, etc. But i try to stay optimistic about it. Know that you are strong enough to endure whatever pain life has in store for you, and the pain will always pass even if it feels permanent in the moment.\n\nI hope some of this helped. My DMs are always open.\n\nDisclaimer: i have an unofficial diagnosis of aspergers syndrome from a counsellor. I have never pursued an official diagnosis due to the costs involved. That said, I\'m pretty sure i am mildly autistic based on the following symptoms: light and sound sensitivity, sometimes get panic/anxiety attacks or blackouts due to being overwhelmed by sensory input, aforementioned brute force learning of social cues, often described by people as ""weird""/""quirky""/""unique""/""on a different wavelength"", and my close friends all agree that i\'m ND in some way.\n\nEdit: spelling and phrasing', 'It gets better but it does majorly suck.', 'Yes.

94,Theory of Constructed Emotion,"['emotion', 'theory']",wquurj,2,"[""It makes sense! I guess this kind of analysis cannot be written by someone who has no bigger problems with feelings.\n\nI have one spesific point of view on my mind. Usually the interpretations about feelings are not made by expressions and sensations alone. Contexts give a good hint about what is going on. In my body, excitement about something not dangerous feels pretty similar to falling in love. So, it is easy to understand that tickling in my stomach because I met that cute and nice girl yesterday and thoughts about her have not vanished from my mind. On another situation, the sensation is easy to connect with a rollercoaster ride I am waiting for.\n\nI'd still say that understanding feelings is not always easy for the typicals, either. I have heard ordinary girls discussing, whether or not they are fallen in love with someone. Fear and excitement, even enthusiasm, can be difficult to tell apart, for example right before that rollercoaster ride.\n\nMy mind and body work in away that I can get physical sensations before anything called a feeling, and even when I clearly notice the feeling I don't necessarily understand the reason or stimulus that caused it. I can get very annoyed without knowing the reason. And even before that I can sense the tensions in my body.\n\nA doctor called my sister alexithymic. I really did wonder why, because I have not had any bigger problems about understanding her feelings. She rarely laughs or cries, but I can tell when she is relaxed, nervous, happy, sad, excited  annoyed etc. Maybe her expressions are so subtle and her doctor does not necessarily know the contexts sufficiently.\n\nSo, did I write anything useful?"", 'Love the mention of ""How Emotions Are Made"". I felt like I understood myself and others a lot better after reading that book. For as long as I can remember, I\'ve wondered about cognitive and affective differences between myself and others. And I\'d be confused by the terms they\'d use to describe different mental states. For instance, when I was in middle school I remember wondering if I was a sociopath because they supposedly didn\'t feel guilt. And when I tried to think about my own experience, I felt like I couldn\'t recall an instance in my life that would quite fit my understanding of what \'guilt\' was. \n\n\nSeveral years later, I remember finding some cash on the ground at school, which I happily took. A little while later I saw a younger kid looking around the ground with a really distressed look on his face around that area. I remember him mouthing the word, ""fuck."" I genuinely felt bad and felt compelled to give him the money, and his face lit up! And I remember thinking, ""oooooohhhh so that must be the \'guilt\' thing that everyone was talking about."" Which is interesting because I do have memories of doing something bad that I\'d later apologize for many years prior to this experience. But this was more of a lightbulb moment that allowed me to actually keep hold of and continue being able to apply the concept. \n\n\nI feel like I\'ve come to understand a lot of the terms people use for different feelings in this fashion. First I\'ll wonder:""hmmm, not sure if I feel *that*"" or ""oh, I definitely don\'t feel *that*"" and then years later I\'ll get enough of a sense of what people mean by a certain emotional term to begin seeing if/how it operates in my own life. \n\n\nA more recent one is ""validation"". The first thing that comes to mind with this concept is my reaction to an episode of Community where one character complains about how another character didn\'t validate her feelings about some rando in traffic (Season 1 episode 6, Shirley complaining about Britta). And it was framed as a moment of growth when Britta learns to do that better. This genuinely confused me because I thought friends are supposed to tell one another the truth and I didn\'t see anything wrong in Britta\'s offering of alternative explanations for the rando\'s behavior. In my experience, when someone is complaining about someone else, they\'re highly likely to ascribe malicious intent and insult that person, when the actual explanation for the conflict is more likely: miscommunication, apathy, or incompetence. My ability to notice this has resulted in frequently occupying a social space where I understand and get along with one person who has serious problems with another person/group, who I also understand and get along with. \n\n\nAnyway, I looked at the idea with suspicion and the idea I began to form of it was such that it made it difficult to impossible for me to identify it: ""Validation is something people seek when they\'re insecure about something and are too emotionally weak  to handle it alone."" \n\n\nThen several years later I was going through a rough patch and complained to my older brother about the problem. He listened and gave me practical advice. I complained to my younger sister and she became more enraged at the people responsible than I was. But the conversation with her actually made me feel soooo much better. It didn\'t matter what her explanation of their behavior was or if it was less accurate than my brother\'s. What mattered was seeing and feeling how much she cared, and how much more expressive she could be about feelings I barely knew I had, and hadn\'t quite learned to interpret. Part of that learning was shedding old stories I told myself about myself. They were usually along the lines of a simple and naive self-image where I imagined myself as ultimately stoic and practical, leaving no room for all the other things people can be. The more rigidly I felt the need to adhere to this self-image, the less able I was to skillfully interact with others, although it helped me in academia to an extent. \n\n\nThe deeper I\'ve gotten into mindfulness meditation, I\'ve noticed an increased ability to alter the reflexive interpretations my mind has with respect to certain sensations and perceptions, which gives me greater awareness and therefore control of negative emotions. Especially if I\'m calm I\'m able to look at certain painful sensations in such a way that detaches the pain from any suffering. The sensation remains, but the anxiety and tension associated with it cease. Think of how pain, depending on the context and intensity, can be a source of total misery or deep enjoyment. People can enjoy the pain of a good workout because of what it signifies but if you take that exact sensation and put it in someone who is in bed and about to go to sleep, it\'ll be a totally different and much more miserable experience.\n\n\nI think the central idea of the book: ‚ÄúAn emotion is your brain‚Äôs creation of what your bodily sensations mean, in relation to what is going on around you in the world‚Äù \nmakes a lot of sense and not only jives with my experience, it helps me understand and navigate the emotions of others.

111,why does everyone seem to insist people are born with autism?,"['autism', 'born']",wr8sn0,0,"['What does it mean to be born with autism? \n\n\nAutism isn\'t like Sickle cell anemia, for example, where a person is born with a quantifiable lack of a particular protein. There\'s no blood test for it and there\'s no brain imaging techniques for it. It\'s *defined* by a wide range of behaviors over a long period of time, many of which a newborn cannot express (autistic or not) and so cannot be assessed for. It can sometimes be detected as early as 18 months with developmental screenings. For that reason alone, nobody is born with autism because the diagnosis cannot be applied to a newborn. The most you can say is that a person is born with a strong predisposition for it. \n\n\n>so i\'ve been looking at studies and it doesn\'t seem like it\'s the case at all? \n\n\nThe causes of autism are multifactorial. Genetics plays a causal role. Environment plays a causal role. Genetic-environment interaction plays a causal role. Nature vs nurture is ultimately a false dichotomy and when it comes to something as complex as human behavior, it\'s never just one or the other. Twin studies are a one useful tool in exploring the natures of the different causes. \n\n\n>both of them sharing the same genetics. \n\n\n[One limitation of twin studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4919929/) is that the environment is not necessarily identical for the two twins even when still developing in the womb. Environmental changes can result in different genetic expression patterns which can in turn affect the environment and so on. This is true inside as well as outside of the womb. Hence: nature vs nurture being a false dichotomy which breaks down on further analysis. It\'s still a useful shorthand in a lot of contexts though which is why it\'s the go-to hand-waving explanation for a lot of popular science media. \n\n\n>judging by the symptoms being almost identical to attachment disorders and cptsd, \n\n\nWhat similarities are you specifically pointing towards? \n\n\n>isn\'t it rational to assume it\'s because of trauma or other bad experiences during infancy? \n\n\nBecause of some symptomatic similarities? No, that\'s a leap. It\'s not known that attachment disorders are caused by trauma. Same with autism which is known to be comorbid with a number of different psychiatric disorders.\n\n\n>so what\'s the deal? is it a scheme to make bad parents feel better about themselves? \n\n\nPeople use scientific information in all sorts of self-serving ways. There\'s no getting around that, and it doesn\'t require a top-down scheme. I feel like the general tendency I see here on this subreddit is towards emphasizing the biological causation. I can only speculate as to why. It seems in line with an overall cultural trend in America wherein its implicit that: minds are best primarily understood in terms of neurons and neurochemicals.\n\n\nI think there\'s something comforting with coming to understand yourself as in accordance with an external set of causal necessities, especially if it comes with greater self-understanding. It\'s easier to accept your past self when you truly understand the causes which made your past self act that way. It can stop the useless stream of ""what if?"" questions. \n\n\n>did i misinterpret something or use bad studies? it seems to me like the common narrative is completely wrong. yes, you are born genetically predisposed to develop autism, but you\'re not actually born with autism\n\n\nCommon narratives are always reductive. That\'s how ""you are born with a genetic predisposition for X"" becomes ""your born with X"".  In common language, people just try to communicate the crux of the issue, as they see it. And for a lot of people, saying ""X is biological"" carries an implicit ""and so you shouldn\'t judge people for X because they can\'t control it"".', '>did i misinterpret something\n\nAlmost certainly. What studies are you looking at?', ""The idea of debating whether autism is a product of nature vs nurture is a false dichotomy based on an outdated paradigm. Modern scientific breakthroughs have led to the discovery of epigenetics, basically genes and the environment working together. Two identical twins could both be born with the same identical genetic baseline for autism, but the environment of one of the twins might have provoked a stronger manifestation of known autism symptoms. There's also enough research to suggest that not everyone's autism symptoms will reveal themselves in the same order, and this may also be due to environmental factors. Some people present as autistic during childhood, while for some, it isn't until they get older and their environment changes."", '&#x200B;\n\nHi, yeah, I think you may have misinterpreted. Which is not strange considering the high level of specialisation of these researchers. They just ARE complex studies.\n\nI have been told that being born too early, too light or starting life in a hot-box (couveuse) may be an environmental factor for autism. I have not found a study to collaborate that! So I don\'t know if it is true.\n\nI did participate in twin-research where the outcome was that autism is for a lot genetic.\n\nThe short version: \n\nIdentical twins have the same genetic material. \n\nNon-identical twins don\'t share the same genetic material.  They are  like normal siblings but born together. They do share the same birth circumstances and upbringing.\n\nIt appears that for identical twins, most often both are autistic OR  both are not autistic.   1 autistic and 1 not autistic is rare.\n\nBut in non-identical twins, this varies much more. Which makes sense if autism is (for a large part) a genetic thing, since non-identical twins share less genetic material.\n\nSo thats how they sort of do the research. \n\n I combed the website for publications that have things to do with autism. Because it looked like people might be interested.\n\nDisclaimer: Although I have had an academic education in chemistry, I am not a gene researcher. So the summaries may be off.\n\nMind you: the percentages are what the researches could prove. They use things like questionaires. That is not as accurate as (for example) measuring the number of red blood cells or testing for allergies which both can be done biologically. So the actual percentages may be higher or lower. \n\n[https://assets.vu.nl/fdcfbfb4-ea5f-0080-b339-861bb5cb584d/cab574f8-0734-4ad4-85a5-e5b07e172c45/2020\\_Slob\\_IJE.pdf](https://assets.vu.nl/fdcfbfb4-ea5f-0080-b339-861bb5cb584d/cab574f8-0734-4ad4-85a5-e5b07e172c45/2020_Slob_IJE.pdf)\n\nConclusion: anitbiotics don\'t make you autistic.

So, there is not 1 autism gene. It is probably more a stacking of variations in \\*multiple\\* genes.\n\n[https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/heritability-of-autistic-traits-in-the-general-population](https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/heritability-of-autistic-traits-in-the-general-population)\n\nIt says autism is hereditairy for 57%  and that people with autism do not pick partners with autisme more often (well, for getting babies). Also that autistic men and women don\'t have different ""autistic genes"".\n\n[https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/the-etiology-of-autistic-traits-in-preschoolers-a-population-base](https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/the-etiology-of-autistic-traits-in-preschoolers-a-population-base)\n\n This one results in autism 83% hereditairy for girls and 78% for boys. It also found that there was no specific ""girl-autism-gene""or ""boy autism gene"": similar genetics in autistic boys and girls. \n\n[https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/parental-age-in-relation-to-offsprings-neurodevelopment](https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/parental-age-in-relation-to-offsprings-neurodevelopment)\n\nHere , they tried to investigate if attention diffeciency and educational succes. They found that the older the mom, the better the kids do. For fathers it was that kids with medium age dads did best. However, this can be explained by the fact that people with higher educations usually get their first kids ar a higher age. So it rather may have to do with the education level/ attention (diff)eciency of the parents than with the age they got kids.', 'The reason people don\'t think it\'s hereditary is because I believe a lot of the DSM symptoms are really just autism with trauma. I am autistic and I have had the traits as long as I can remember. I also have a son that has shown obvious signs from VERY early on. Many people go through their lives not realising they are autistic because they either have no trauma, or their autistic traits have been suppressed through trauma, normally leaving other symptoms at the forefront like substance abuse, alcoholism or severe dissociative disorders.\n\nI believe autism is inherited, but societal norms and environmental factors dictate the severity of some other traits that I honestly don\'t think are directly because of the autism. (Social ""defecits"" for example).', ""From what I understand about it (what the clinical psychologist who diagnosed me with ASD said) is that autism can develop when any three genes (of 48 specific ones) mix together.  \n\nI almost failed biology.

If I'm wrong, please tell me why and give me a source."", 'Just an FYI - being born with something is not synonymous with it being genetic.

The clock is ticking and each of us have only a finite amount of time. If the company has less sales and less of a budget, they have two options: cut their R&D and production to cut costs or increase sales.\n\nInstead, their strategy seems to be to force you to work more hours with zero extra pay. When you signed your work contract, it was for an 8 hour day, roughly 40 hours per week, right?

That is theft. They are taking something they don't own without compensation for their own benefit.\n\nIt is important to keep your word and be an honorable person. Thus, if you go to a restaurant and order $10 worth of food, you are honor bound to pay that $10 after you eat. Or you can pay first, and then the restaurant is honor bound to give you $10 worth of food. If you order $10 worth of food and then the restaurant demands you pay them $50, you are not honor bound to pay them that $50.\n\nLikewise, when you signed your work contract, they agreed to pay you for 40 hours a week, and you are honor bound to give them 40 hours a week. You can choose to give more, but that is your life and your choice. You are NOT honor bound to give them 70 or 80 hours. When you work more, you are volunteering your life and giving it freely as a favor to them, they do not own it and cannot demand it.\n\nCan you imagine this in reverse. Would you ever create a business and plan things so that unless your workers work for free, extra hours, that your business will fail? What kind of fool would do that? They are not a volunteer charity organization, they are a for-profit business. They are either lying to you in order to exploit you, or they are completely incompetent in planning their business, and they deserve to pay the price for their mistakes, you do not deserve to suffer the price of decisions that they did not even involve you in, and they have no right to demand that you do.\n\nYou have several options on the table:\n\n1.

If you stop giving them your time for free, only then will they have to find alternative solutions.\n3. Let yourself be bled dry until you suffer permanent health problems and literally lose years of your life.\n\nIn all cases, just the very fact that you chose to not be bled dry and treated no better than an office printer that they burn through and throw out, means that you may face retaliation. It doesn't matter if you are right, to many office managers, you are a thing, not a person, and they will simply wait for the moment to strike, take everything you built, and leave you empty handed.\n\nI recommend preparing for that retaliation by updating your resume, and start scheduling a few interviews.

140,DAE have severe social anxiety?,"['anxiety', 'social']",wptjpo,14,"[""I associate social difficulties to two buckets - social anxiety and social processing.\n\nThe anxiety bit is the usual anxious feelings but for a social situation. This bucket's one I was able to improve in significantly with traditional anxiety related advice (don't feed the beast, let the emotion run it's course instead of giving in to fight, flight, freeze; breathe, etc.).\n\nBut the other component of social processing is just how my brains wired. Everyone has a copy of a play they were given through social interaction wifi to know what to say, when to say it, what to emote, what to do, etc. My copy never downloaded so I had to write it from scratch, and so it's a bloated process, that also never kicks in instintually (like how you breathe automatically until you don't, then you breathe manually - but the social never kicks in automatically, or at least not covering as many things). So not only do I have a soclal manual that isn't totally accurate (saying wrong thing, wrong way, wrong time, wrong non-verbal reads and projections, etc), I am running through the steps as zi try to also listen. All part of the mask.\n\nThis I can mostly alleviate in the right places by just dropping the mask, if the interaction allows it. I can make the manual somewhat more efficient, by making assumptions for things I can check less often, or have more experiences to pull from, but it will always take more out of me than it would someone else. And that's okay, if I know this I can work with it.\n\nSo these days, I wouldn't say that I've completely overcome it, or figured out a perfect solution, I have it down to something I can manage in the right doses. I won't be a party animal but I can do it once in a while and while I'll feel drained by the end of it, I won't feel like it was a complete loss. Recognizing it was two separate root issues helped me, as my anxiety was subconsciously learned behaviour I could unlearn. Processing, well, it's easier but still have the wrong hardware to really optimise that process so acknowledging that and working to maximize the software, so to speak, means it's easier but it's still hard."", ""Mine isn't severe but I have it when I'm in situations where I'm interacting with groups in an unstructured way.

I ended up coming off actually quite natural and charismatic over the phone with that practice.  \n\nNow I wouldn‚Äôt say my phone anxiety is 100% gone at this point but it‚Äôs certainly mild enough that it does not prevent me from making necessary phone calls like it used to, and as far as tripping over my words I‚Äôve learned how to recover gracefully.  \n\nIf you feel yourself messing up when talking I recommend making taking a breath, repeating what you meant to say slowly and with emphasis, and if you feel like you made yourself look bad, just add a little acknowledgement of your blunder; ‚Äúoh gosh, been tripping over my words today!‚Äù or something similar should garner appropriate sympathy.', ""I'm happy to see the comments on here, because my initial thought was: No, it won't.\nThat's based on my own experience, where I never had any improvement in regards to making calls at work.

It‚Äôs different.', ""I had a job where I had to make a lot of calls to clients. The guy that trained me was super outgoing and jovial on the phone. I just adopted his phone personality, almost exactly (his word choices, cadence, inflection, etc). It made it easier to get over that phone anxiety. And as I got better at the job and learned what aspects of his personality didn't quite work for me, I gradually adapted my phone personality until it sounded pretty natural (at least I hink it sounded natural). Maybe that kind of approach could help? Good luck at the new job!"", ""The secret to getting better at anything is practice, so I'm sure you're gonna be fine"", 'Love the encouraging comments here. I actually enjoy public speaking but even for personal calls I often write out what needs to be said and rehearse depending on the topic and seriousness. It will be a great opportunity to gain some confidence and strengthen your speaking skills. Sending you good vibes!!', 'So, with the vast majority of people here saying practice makes it easier, I\'ll just throw out a counter-example. I\'ve been in my job for for over 15 years, and my ability to do the ""public speaking"" aspect has actually gotten WORSE over time. Just today, I had to ask permission from my boss (in front of a dozen other department heads) to NOT to have to introduce my  new faculty members at the upcoming annual fall meeting, because I already know it\'s going to suck, even though I would be (based on previous years\' screwups) using a script. I just can\'t deliver a smooth speech in English (my native language) without shaking, stuttering, and sounding like an absolute idiot. It\'s the most humiliating aspect of my job. It\'s not a lot better on the phone. My partner and I get along amazingly (both of us over 40 y.o.), but anytime we have to make a phone call (for example, to the cable company, bank, town Hall, garbage pickup people, or even just ordering pizza), it becomes a fight about who should actually make the call--that\'s how much we both hate picking up the phone.\n\nSo, maybe it gets better with practice, and maybe it doesn\'t. In the end, your ability (or lack thereof) to be a wonderful public (or telephone) speaker is a tiny piece of who you are as a person, and there\'s no reason to beat yourself up over this or that little imperfection.']",https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wpjejx/i_dread_making_a_phone_call_because_i_stutter/

I did have a relationship with an at the time 18 y.o. girl (I\'m 16), who claimed to have BPD, along with OCD and anxiety. Yes, she mentioned being clinically diagnosed, and i can confirm that she still goes to the psychiatrist to this day.  \n As to our relationship, we didn\'t actually date, but gradually our friendship evolved to a closer friendship, followed by us engaging in intimacy. Eventually it got to the point where we were seeing each other almost everyday, and suprisingly we were able to keep the romantic/sexual part of our relationship secret.  \n This went on for a couple of months, and it was a fun time, until I eventually stopped responding to her when she reached out. I will elaborate on our relationship dynamics within this time period, and then will talk about why I decided to terminate it.  \n I have 150 (tested) IQ. If you\'re familiar with the Communication Range theory, you know it\'s difficult to relate to people further than 30 points of your score. Even if you\'re not, you\'ve seen the stereotype of the lonely genius, who\'s not understood by anyone. The average IQ in my country is 86. I\'m obviously autistic as well. That being said, it was hard to connect to people (as you well know), even after i had learnt a lot through trial and error and had solid social skills. That\'s because people just seemed uninteresting.   \n But why am I stating the obvious? Because that\'s exactly what got me into all of this. Highly intelligent people are usually able to identify one another, given even little information about each other. After a few weeks of knowing her (the how is not relevant), I sensed she was interesting, and started creating connection. Sure enough, she was tested to have 140 IQ. I had found someone to discuss philosophy with, to hear about their interpretation of art and to talk in english with (we\'re both self-taught).   \n Eventually, i began developing physical attractiveness (my mind doesn\'t really know how to differ physical from intellectual connection, call me demisexual if it pleases you). She had it as well. However, after some fun times, it came to me that I didn\'t really find her attractive, and was just confused. She is extremely sentimental as well (likely narcissistic), and you and i both know we hate to deal with feelings, especially extraneous ones.  \n The reason I had to bring up the IQ factor is that it was my prime motivator for seeking the relationship, even though i didn\'t find her attractive nor matched her personality. Of course, this wouldn\'t last.   \n As to the influence borderline had in our relationship, I\'d say the problem was mostly the fear of abandonment. It\'s cumbersome to have to reassure someone constantly, and to make sure they\'re feeling ok. The sudden mood swings were fine because she\'d always go have them by herself, she didn\'t express them, only seldom through text. Ignoring all the self-harming symptoms of BPD, I\'d say that\'s all. Luckily, she found other people she found interesting, which ""distracted"" her from me, and we\'ve never addressed this topic directly so she wasn\'t that much hurt.   \n HOWEVER, If you\'re willing to date a BPD, or are already doing so, I would advise you to be extremely careful, because i\'d assume the outcome in my case is extremely atypical. In most cases, breaking bonds with BPDs is a serious deal, and they may injure themselves (or even you, or someone else, who knows). If you are doubtful of your opinions on the person in question, tread carefully, and don\'t commit just yet, is my advice. Fastidiously evaluate what exactly is that you like and (this is important) dislike about the BPD. That\'s pivotal because it may be the case that you\'ll not want to be committed anymore some time from now. Especially considering you\'re autistic (i suppose), and the burden of taking care of an extremely emotional person is not easy to bear.  \n\n\nTL;DR: I did. It wasn\'t bad, but definitely don\'t go into it without pondering upon it beforehand, you\'re messing with fire.

Life exists on this planet due to similar reasons. There's no need to think about it further, in my opinion."", 'The explanation I like the most is summarized in this [minutephysics video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxTnqKuNygE) with special appearance by Sean Carroll. Carroll goes into more detail about ""hydrogenating carbon dioxide"" in one of his other, full length presentations on the big picture. Here\'s a [one-hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BH6XCRZad8) (relevant bit starts at 21:15).\n\nBut, to summarize, the quote stems from [a scientist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Russell_(scientist)), who hypothesized that the purpose of life is to increase the entropy of the Universe. His theory went that the very first organisms on Earth would have arisen when the Earth\'s atmosphere was loaded with carbon dioxide, and would increase entropy by breathing out methane; that there was no one simple chemical reaction that would allow the higher-entropy methane atoms to reach a higher entropy state, but a series of more complex ones would do that. The more complex reactions became more and more complex to the point they became self-sustained - in the form of life.\n\nOh, and, he made a scientific prediction that backed his theory (explained at the 21:15-23:15 mark of the long video). The very first life on Earth, may have breathed methane! It also caused some scientists to consider searching for life on planets with methane atmospheres instead of surfaces with liquid water ([here\'s an article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/fayeflam/2014/12/23/five-reasons-searching-for-methane-breathing-martians-isnt-completely-crazy/)).\n\nSo despite the lack of clear consensus on the origins of life, that theory does count among the ""more interesting ones"", precisely because of that scientific validation.\n\nAnd by the way, free-form oxygen is not native to Earth. That\'s very much the result of photosynthesis whose [advent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Oxidation_Event) caused a major climate change and a mass-extinction event.\n\nSide note: plastic is not bio-degradable, because it\'s in a very low-energy/high entropy state, i.e. it may as well have reached its purpose according to life (under that theory). As George Carlin quipped, the answer why we (humans) are here, could very well be ""Plastic! Assholes!"".\n\n^((plastics are bad, but in the end, the maximum amount of entropy would spell the end of the Universe itself, so mission succeeding?))\n\nAnyway, what I like about that take on the purpose of life (assuming purpose = meaning), is that it takes into account other life, other than humans. Whatever the meaning of life is, it should be applicable as much as to us, as it would be to the lowliest of bacteria.', ""Thinking about the meaning of life is a big red existentual depression coming up flag.\n\nMabe I've taken to many drugs and listened to to many non duel teachings but, I Am and that's probably the most sene we can make of it.

Since we are the universe and not separate from it anything we think or do is something happening in that universe. We are the part of the universe that is self aware of itself. Since we have the idea of meaning it thus exists. So our life does have meaning, but perhaps not meaning beyond our own interpretation of it.

However, I do ask myself questions like "" is there a system of ethics?"" - which means, is there any actual answer to the question what I should do.\n\nI believe existence to fundamentally stem from ignorance, most notably the ignorance of oneself, which I believe to be the essence of the soul. Not knowing who I am is what I am, because, if I could know what I am, I would be able to know what I\'m not - but then I would be knowing that, so it would be a part of me after all. Because also then this ""knowing myself"" has to be a part of me, if I can know that I\'m not that, I at the same time can\'t know myself and my unknowledge, in the same way, which leads me to believe they are the same thing. Therefore, I am that I don\'t know who I am\n\nAs such contradictory, I can\'t really say that there is any meaning to life, because that would imply there is a specific meaning of something that I don\'t even know what it is or if it\'s there. Because I\'m not sure of my own existence, and am that unclearity itself to myself, I can\'t really look into it but as into a mystery. And then the question is really rather: what should I do? Or specifically: What can I know and imagine? What do I want from those things? And then, do I want to do what I want or do I want to be distant to my own desire? - to that last question I still lack any answer, as I still don\'t quite know what that should mean, to want or to desire something', 'So many times man...', 'Meaning is a relative concept.

I think there are a few root problems, though solution would have to be natural and creative, though an autism specialist can help too (but not a regular normal therapist, those are way over rated and end up damaging people often). One, is you don't sound like a happy family, you don't do activities together you enjoy. You also sound alienated from each other, in other words, the son is not needed inside the family to contribute to family goals and errands and does not help solve any family problems as you are competent and rich enough for that. So there is no natural need to connect him to the family or for him to do anything arising from your socioeconomic circumstances. So that is bad, it means he is less stimulated and not connected that way at least. Second, you did everything for him and provide for everything currently and in the future. That creates 'affluenza' type of ailment because there is not natural financial need for him to do anything now or later because you are there.

On one hand, there's been an increase in autism awareness, and probably a bit more for autism on women. So many ladies are starting to figure out that they might be on the spectrum and now they're being diagnosed. As many said before, the diagnosis criteria were focused on male behavior, so lots of women couldn't be properly assessed until recently.\n\nOn the other hand, there's been a mental health crisis in young people all over the world. So many folks want to find a reason to explain their mental issues and suddenly autism makes sense for them, and they self-diagnose. And that's why I'm very cautious with self-diagnosis. It's pretty easy to think autism is the root cause of all your struggles and you keep taking more and more screening tests to self-validate, sometimes forcing questions to be answered in a way that fit the diagnosis criteria. This happened to me, but with ADHD. Only until I was assessed by a psychiatrist, it turned out that my ADHD was just overlapping symptoms with ASD.\n\nAnd you have a third group of people that do it for likes, views and whatever magic internet points you want to mention.

But I wouldn\'t discourage self-diagnosis just because of these outliers as it would discourage people who are actually autistic from doing so.

Themes identified in this research include the concept of ‚Äòmasking‚Äô, or portraying a non-autistic persona (Bargiela et al. 2016; Tierney et al. 2016), and the idea that through copying others and controlling behavioural expression, autistic girls and women could compensate for some of the social and communication difficulties they experienced (Dean et al. 2017). This qualitative research suggested that there may be some negative consequences of camouflaging. These include links to heightened stress or mental health conditions such as depression, and reduced access to clinical support and services as a result of difficulties being hidden (Cage et al. 2017; Head et al. 2014). Autistic females‚Äô camouflaging may even account for the later and less frequent diagnoses of females than males with the same autistic characteristics (Begeer et al. 2013; Giarelli et al. 2010; Rutherford et al. 2016). In addition, some qualitative research that has begun to look at the experiences of camouflaging amongst autistic men suggests that while both men and women may camouflage their autism, there might be gendered differences in both the techniques used and the consequences of camouflaging (Hull et al. 2017).', 'It‚Äôs no secret that autism often goes unnoticed and undiagnosed in women as they‚Äôre generally better at masking.

It is what the USA constitution describes. Ironically the fact that they avoided mentioning political parties in the constitution contributed to the current two party system. They didn\'t want parties when writing it, but when it came time to put the constitution into action the ""federalists"" and ""anti-federalists"" went from just two positions on a specific issue into proper political parties extremely quickly.\n\nIf the democrats split into two the undivided republicans would always win, if the republicans split, the undivided democrats would always win. In theory you could have three equal parties, but in history or simulations it doesn\'t last long. One party gets ahead and the other two have to work together to beat them. Re-balancing is more likely to happen with two parties. There were periods of US history where a single party dominated, but it would not have helped either the dominant party nor the opposition party to split up.\n\nOf course right now is an unusual time. The democrats still feel the urge to appeal to centrist voters. Trying to appeal to centrist ""swing voters"" is how the 50-50 split is normally maintained I think, but the republicans have abandoned that. They know they can get ahead with just the far right. Economic trends have left people looking towards more extreme ideologies. Fox News has had the effect of moving right wing people farther to the right. The news in general treats politics like a game. Republic voters tend to be extremely loyal, voting simply to support their identity group, believing alternative facts, responding to emotional manipulation. Of course the nature of the senate and electoral college is to give extra power to states with smaller populations, which now tend to be very republican.\n\nSo getting out of the two party system would require a dramatic change to the constitution. That change would have to happen under the current two party system. Most people who say this are mostly frustrated with the way Democrats ignore the left, but creating a third actually progressive party would just help the republicans.

On the Senate vote, usually there's a limit to the number of votes you need to put in (six, generally), so you often don't even get to the sewer-level parties if you don't want to.\n\nBut yeah. Depending on which minor parties you've put before your first major, enough pre-major votes for one of those parties tends to mean they end up with seats, and therefore a degree of influence over legislation in the next parliamentary term.

I basically create three fundamental political questions, and plot parties according to those axes.\n\n**Axis 1: Question of Equality - Left/Right**\n\nStemming from the [original political science definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_political_spectrum#Origins_in_the_French_Revolution), a ""right"" position is associated a belief that people are inherently unequal, and that there are superior and inferior classes of people which form a hierarchy. Those that are superior should have preferential access to the rewards of society and fewer burdens. The determination of this hierarchy can be based on race, religion, ability, etc. A extreme ""left"" position is that people are inherently equal, and are equally entitled to the rewards and burdens of society.\n\n**Axis 2: Question of Concentration of Power - Liberal/Authoritarian**\n\nUltimately the rational for concentration power is one of fundamental human nature. A [Hobbesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Hobbes) view is that humans are fundamentally evil in nature, and that left to their own devices, would be destructive. Therefore, most power and decision making should be limited to a small number of trustworthy individuals, which is an authoritarian view. The opposite is a liberal view, which is based more on a [Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke) view in which human nature is viewed as fundamentally good, thus, decision making power should lie as close to the general public as possible, where they have the most access to information needed to know the right rules, thus, few laws need to be enforced from above.\n\n**Axis 3: Question of Change - Progressive/Conservative**\n\nThese views stem from one\'s beliefs around change. A common conservative (little c) argument is that society is so complex, that determining the impact any given law will have is nearly impossible, and in most cases, will actually make things worse. Thus, they believe that the right course of action is to keep with laws and traditions that have withstood the test of time. A progressive view is that the behavior and nature of society can be understood with sufficient forethought and experimentation, and that laws should be changed in order to fix problems and improve society. Any harm that comes from mistakes can simply be corrected by further future changes to the law.\n\nUsing such a system, I find it far easier to have a consistent classification of the true nature of political parties. In the USA, the two major parties are actually quite close together (or they were in the early 2010s), and there\'s a wide spectrum of political thought which no major political party represents.

Blokes drink to kill nerves and then can‚Äôt keep things working which ends up having the opposite effect, so know your limits. \n\nPay her some compliments, take your time, make eye contact, ask for consent at each step as in ‚ÄúI‚Äôd really like to kiss you right now‚Äù and see how she reacts, if she gets drunk don‚Äôt do anything.', 'It‚Äôs super important to make a girl (or whoever) feel comfortable as a man. I think ‚Äúmaking a move‚Äù isn‚Äôt really the best approach as it seems like an all or nothing attempt. \nI think it‚Äôs best to take a ‚Äúlevels‚Äù approach. A mentality that it‚Äôs about building up the move and not just sporadically making a move. For example, id say the first level is eye contact. Look at her eyes, her lips, her body even. Is she looking in your eyes? Next I‚Äôd say proximity. Get a little close to her, see how she reacts, does she move towards you or away ? If all goes well, you can test out with touch, when appropriate of course. Does she reciprocate or does she move away/ look uneasy? If she accepts and touches you back you can progress, so on and so forth. \n\nIt‚Äôs all about building up slowly to make sure she‚Äôs consenting and comfortable as you guys increase the ‚Äúintensity‚Äù so to speak. A bonus of this strategy is that it build anticipation and tension. Going straight in for a kiss without having touched, looking at their lips etc. Is too big of a jump and is often the reason girls reject it. Girls who reject a kiss always say ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt expecting it at all‚Äù. \n\nI also find that having this tier list type method is helpful due to how simplistic and easy to apply it is since I‚Äôm bad with social cues and nuances. \n\nTo sum it up. There is not one ‚Äúmove‚Äù, but a gradual increase of intimacy to keep her comfortable and not caught off guard. Take your time, it build tension and anticipation. \n\nAs for the tier list it goes, once both parties have gotten to that level, you go to the next. (Ex: you touch her, she touches you, or vice versa then you can move on) \n\n1: Eye contact (look at her, don‚Äôt avoid her) \n2: Proximity (get close to her) \n3: Touch (playful/light ex: shoulder, hands, arm) \n4: Touch (a little more intention, ex: legs, neck, hair, waist) \n5: Kiss (self explanatory) \n\nObviously it‚Äôs not always in order, depends on the situation, but kiss should come last most of the time. \n\nFinal tip: the most IMPORTANT thing is to make her feel comfortable. That means you need to be comfortable. If she is comfortable she will show you what she wants ;).']",https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wp09zm/how_do_you_make_the_move_during_a_hookup/

Showing ""the work"" in a math class (even though you can look at the problem and figure out the answer) is a great example.  Later you\'ll understand why you must rely on laying out ""the work"" in order to solve challenging math/physics/whatever problems.\n\nThe teachers train you to write essays, and endless other crap in endless other curriculums, but they all demand things done in a specific way...\n\nThey bring you to a level you can\'t breeze through anymore. Then keep going.  Far past those points.  You wind up having to just trust them (the good ones at least) and get through it regardless.\n\nThis means you have to be prepared to read textbooks, do homework exercises, and study for exams until you\'re done.  These concepts were invisible to me at first, and I saw the same problem in a majority of the students I salvaged... but explaining how to pass to other aspies was different.\n\nWe often don\'t even think out why we\'re attended college, much less realize we desperately needed advice to succeed when we\'re failing.  The issue is not being aware we have a problem while there\'s still time fix it... so I had to basically tell aspies (just like me when I was a newbie) to open their eyes. \n\nThe answer became helping them realize what kind of professional industry they wanted to work in, pick work they\'d love despite other\'s opinions, and suggest they shore up any shortcomings they\'d neglected in General Ed that\'ll make them needlessly suffer in their upper division classes. (Like English, Math, or study habbits.)\n\nSadly...  If they were there ""just because"" then they weren\'t worth any effort helping them stumble towards the graduation ceremony.

In reality this line is fairly nonsense, since every individual is so unique that pretty much everyone has a few symptoms of every spectrum. Wether you identify as NT or not, depends on where you draw said line for yourself. Both my parents for example have symptoms that comply with autism, but are far from actually autistic. I however have more of those symptoms and I've been officially diagnosed with autism, but I also have some AD(H)D symptoms even though I'm far from actually ADHD.\n\nIt is very much possible that you fall dead centre between NT, ASD and ADHD.

I also got this ability to just go on, create stuff I need from materials I happen to have. I am pretty creative and can figure out to do things without complicated and expencive equipment.\n\nPeople for sure don't appreciate dung beetles. Sure, scarabs have gained some fame but earth boring ones are often seen nasty although they also have their place in nature. People also see me as suspicious, stupid and messed up. Sometimes they think I am lot weaker than I actually amm because I am a small guy. These dung beetles are really strong diggers and I can also surprise people.\n\nI would like to think that I have a place in society too although people don't notice it. I would like to think that I have helped others. Dung beetles are harmless to humans and are often unseen. They are needed though. They usually prefer to feed on dung from cattle so they really are helpful to people.\n\nI strongly agree what you said about dogs by the way. I think people should just stop breeding dogs that will just suffer or at least start going to a healthier direction. And the first priority should always be to keep the breed as healthy as possible. Quality over quantity."", ""I have always viewed dogs with curiosity. They are so malleable and they demonstrate so clearly the impact our environment has on us. A dog can be a trained killer. Left on its own, it can be an opportunistic predator and a scavenger. But the exact same animal can show bravery and loyalty at truly heroic proportions, saving others from death, giving everything they have and more to defend others. They have in spirit the ability to be a devil or an angel. I think humans and dogs may be brothers in this regard.\n\nAlso dogs rarely ever lie, they're up front and honest, even when they're malicious. This is a very admirable trait.\n\nI can never figure out what cats are thinking, and their unpredictability is an almost endless source of enjoyment.\n\nBut to be honest, I kinda view most animals as like mini-people. Like if I'm walking on the side walk and see a snail or a pigeon, I pause to let them pass or move aside. If I see bugs in the house bumping against a window, I'll open up that window to let them be on their way.\n\nI do however make an exception for mosquitos.

Social bonds, language, distinct personalities- so often I hear those things described as human traits when even my gerbils have them.\n\nOne animal I enjoy comparing myself to (and would want to be if I had to choose) is the alpine chough. Fourth highest flying bird in the world, intelligent and resourceful. Content both alone and in groups. I often see them fly when hiking and am awed every time. When I was a child, I told my therapist I'd probably be a wolf if I were an animal, and she said she thought of me as a bird of prey, circling above with a calm, analytical eye. I was flattered, but honestly the main reasons I identify with the alpine chough is much more simple- I love mountains.""]",https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wor54c/do_you_identify_with_animals_and_why/
216,Just Diagnosed #2 - Losing my Shit!,"['diagnosed', 'losing']",wouqql,6,"[""That is a lot :) I will respond to a few items but I don't think my boss will like me taking time to answer all of them :) \n\nI think 1 hour therapy is a way to help you process the diagnosis and to answer questions you may have. Often the total number of therapy hours are limited so using only 1 per week is a way to give you support for longer. It is also useful if you have questions or want to talk through something that happened that week. \n\nI think the diagnosis gives you a lot to think about and probably you are getting a lot of information to process. A lot of us have trouble processing a lot of new information (it goes slower) and while you are processing it / making space in your world-view for new concepts / adjusting the way you think to new ideas it can feel like everything is coming at you at the same time. I used to feel aggrevated when I got my diagnosis.\n\nAnger may be a coping strategy but it may be you're just overwhelmed and your response to this feeling is a mild fight response. \n\nBeing overwhelmed is something that doesn't go away when you want it to. It's not like other bodily functions where you get urgency to pee for instance, then you pee, then you feel ok. But it does go away over time. For me at least when I get a lot of impulses and/or emotions I get in that overwhelmed state and can't cope with new things and everything that is happening that is unexpected adds to my stress.\n\nWhen I felt overwhelmed I had just gotten my diagnosis after suffering from burn-out and then both cats got sick (with different things) and my therapist dropped me because I was too stressed and they wanted me to unwind first because they were concerned it was giving me too much to handle.\n\nThat last part really messed me up but at the same time I think they were right. I was already dealing with too many things at the same time. It made me suicidal because for some reason my brain thinks death is a valid way to avoid stressful situations. Brains are stupid :)\n\nI definitely have more than one mind, in the sense that I can observe myself thinking sometimes. Pratchett has a nice reference about that with first thoughts, second thoughts, third thoughts. \n\nI think it is important to realize that you are being over-sensitive. Not in the way NT's use it though. When they say that they say you are creating drama/taking things personally and should stop it. I mean it the other way. Accept that you are extra sensitive about things. Part of therapy can be to find out what you are sensitive about. change in routines, abrupt change in mood / emotions of others, change in temperature or clothing texture, emotional charge when confronted with failure or rejection. Figure out what you are very sensitive to and you will know what to avoid or what to give yourself extra time for to unwind after it happens.\n\nBasically: You have to start compiling the manual for yourself. And then you also have to start reading and heeding the manual you wrote. And updating it.\n\nThe manual we get from neurotypical people (they pass this on to one another as part of societal pressure) doesn't work for us most of the time. Some bits work but we need to understand what the differences are.\n\nTake a deep breath. Allow yourself to be autistic (as in, allow the mask to be off a bit). Allow yourself to not go at the speed NT's go at on every aspect. This can mean you go faster in some things or slower in others. Not always literally. Sometimes it means if something happens or you need to do a stressful thing you cancel appointments for the rest of the week. Sometimes it means only staying for an hour at a busy party. \n\nStuff like that. But mostly: give it time. You only just found out. You have years and years to adjust and be more comfortable. You have a lot of routines that you had to learn that you thought everyone did but it turns out everyone else never needed them. They got to sit in a busy room without it bothering them. They could see people break the rules without it giving them a sense of dread. (and so on and so on). \n\nSo give it time and take the long view. First job: take a breath and drink some water (a lot of us are bad at maintaining our bodies. find a routine for yourself that has you drink plenty of water.). Second job: think of the number 1 and 2 things you would like to talk to the therapist about. What have you been wondering about, what thing you suspect everyone else has an easy time with but takes all your energy. \n\nStart from there and just focus on one step at a time. You can't get all the information in your head at the same time so divide it into smaller parts and take them on one by one. \n\nThat's my best effort advice based on only a few years of having a diagnosis. I'm not much further than you but I have had some of the WTF feelings you describe and I never really got answers but I did get calmer and life is better now. I still get frustrated and confused and therapy hasn't really worked for me but that doesn't mean it doesn't work. I just thought it was something you did and then everything was fixed. Which really isn't how it works. I'm about to start soon on a fresh attempt but this time with the long view and with less high expectations.\n\nalso: so much for only answering a few points :D"", ""You're one of us"", ""Hey. It sounds like you're going through a lot right now. And yes, it's huge news. But I just want to let you know, you are still the same person as from before your diagnosis. That's all it was, a diagnosis. It doesn't cure anything, it doesn't change a thing about you. You're still you. Always have been. All the diagnosis does is grant some insight into your condition. \n\nTo answer your questions: \n\nI think it's a good idea to look at why you're angry. You've just been handed a lot of life changing information after all. Are you angry because you wish you didn't have autism? Are you angry at people in your life for not pointing it out sooner? \n\nI only have one mind. If you feel like you have two, you can be screened for a dissociative disorder, though depending on how you got your diagnosis this may have been ruled out already. Why don't you like yourself when you aren't following masking rules? And remember, people change over time. By a lot. Think how different you were 5 years ago. If there's something you don't like about your under-the-mask self, you can change it. \n\nI personally don't feel like you're being over sensitive. You've just had a lot happen to you and you're trying to make sense out of all of it. As for whether this thing is even real, it's just a diagnosis. It doesn't force you into anything. What you do from here on out is up to you. You can go back to your life or you can try to modify it to better suit you, knowing what you now know."", '1. Take the time you need.

I pick up my kids (both autistic unsurprisingly) from childcare when my wife is still working, do the dinner, play with them, cleaning up all the chaos, bedtime routines, etc. \n\nI still get judgements from others when I just don\'t have the energy left to do something, however I feel it isn\'t anyone elses business to know and I shouldn\'t have to justify myself to anyone else. I\'m sick of everyone looking around and making assumptions and picking faults in others.\n\nYou don\'t know someone else\'s mind. You don\'t know what they may be struggling with, or what they may or may not be capable of. I honestly think more people should mind their business and those on this forum should really know better. Yeah, we get dismissed a lot, but ""an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind"".\n\nIf it\'s affecting you directly, by all means bring it up and talk to them. if it doesn\'t affect you directly and you\'re just forming an opinion on an assumption... I suggest not doing that. Yes, you may be putting in a hell of a lot of effort, but that doesn\'t give you the right to start judging others.

If I overextend my energy (which takes frighteningly little), I can't count on being able to recover in a day, and I've experienced that the fatigue accumulates. I have mental and physical exhaustion in waves throughout the day. The strategies I used to compensate for my executive function difficulties don't work anymore. Because I am independent, I am now, after not having been able to work and draining my savings, working 2 low-mid-level part-time jobs and am barely maintaining. I feel like my brain has gone to tunnel vision, where I can't see related factors and I look stupid or like I'm not trying, and trying to get others to do the work for me (because my brain didn't connect related factors to follow up on or include in how I did the task). Coworkers  explain rudimentary things to me that I've done for years. It's terrifying, because I need to support myself.\n\nI'm trying, in this condition, to also coordinate my health care to see if there's some solution.

Another fun part of all that is when it happens it will also be at a moment of crisis AND high visibility - which all combined make it the single worst time to demonstrate you don't know how to do your job.\n\nIt puts a smile on my face when I remember the idiots that set themselves on fire just this way."", ""I only get upset if it directly impacts me.

245,"I see often the claim that ""Autism/Aspergers is good actually in part because we are more likely to be completely honest' or something similar. This is incorrect. It's more important to know when to be honest and when not to be than to tell the truth all the time.","['autism', 'aspergers']",wo2oez,39,"['Agreed. I think part of the issue here, and I see this come up in these subs when it comes to this topic quite often, is the idea that it‚Äôs a simple binary between ‚Äútelling the truth‚Äù and ‚Äúlying‚Äù, which it‚Äôs not. In many instances where autistic people run into trouble because they were ‚Äútoo honest‚Äù, it isn‚Äôt that they should have lied instead; rather, that they should either not have said anything at all, or should have phrased it differently. \n\nCorollaries to that, I think, are two views related to this that I‚Äôve repeatedly come across in these subs as well, that seem to factor into this. One, that being anything other than direct and explicit in what you say is somehow dishonest, making eg. being tactful inherently a form of lying on this view (and not saying anything as well, in a sense). And two, that phrasing shouldn‚Äôt matter, because it ultimately means the same thing however it is said (which is just a fundamental misunderstanding of how human communication works).\n\nIn that sense, I say it goes beyond just an aversion to lying, to an at best quite oversimplified view held by some autistic people of what ‚Äúlying‚Äù and ‚Äúbeing honest‚Äù even means. Even a strict deontological view (as untenable as that indeed generally is) wouldn‚Äôt (necessarily) go nearly as far.', ""I can't stand being inauthentic, but I would lie my ass off to protect someone I care about if the circumstances were right. For example, if I know the punishment is going to be way worse than the crime, I can see no benefit to that kind of honesty. We are less likely to lie for personal gain, but it's absolutely possible and does happen. \n\nThere are some autistics that actually believe autistics aren't capable of doing wrong and that's false and harmful. Some of us are total assholes."", 'I generally believe that honesty is the best path forward in most cases. And as /u/MeanderingDuck stated, there\'s more options that simply telling the truth and lying. In the example of the murderer, there\'s also the option of simply refusing to answer. The second example of randomly spouting out offensive thoughts isn\'t helpful either, because a respect for telling the truth does not imply that you must say everything to everyone. Again, there\'s always the option of just saying nothing.\n\nIn many professions, however, the normal tendency of neuto-typical people to tell ""soft lies"" in order to spare people\'s feelings, preserve their ego, or to avoid conflict can lead to serious problems. Are you working on a design of a circuit board that will be in a product printed out millions of times? Well, if you don\'t spot that flaw now, it can put you out of business. Are you working on a medical diagnosis? A software system for a bank? Military? Safety and environmental protection?\n\nThe real problem is the caustic and purposeful lying that is common in society that is done frequently for selfish reasons. E.g. taking credit for someone else\'s work, blaming your mistakes on others, bearing false witness to preserve your relationship with the offender rather than helping the victim, lying to gain someone\'s trust so that it can be exploited for your financial gain (fraud).\n\nAt the micro level, there are many reasons why someone would want a liar. For example, a murderer who wants a lawyer to hide evidence, mislead the jury, and avoid punishment would certainly desire a liar. However, the general health and productivity of a society depends heavily on its ability to distinguish truth from lies.\n\nSocieties that fail to do this, and end up institutionalizing lying, end up with corrupt governments, ineffective courts, industry crippled by graft, and productivity siphoned away through bribes and embezzlement.\n\nI would take an honest society over a dishonest one any day of the week, and I suspect virtually all countries lean too heavily on the side of dishonesty and are paying a price of inefficiency due to it.', 'Definitely sounds like you are mistaking honesty with just speaking your mind and obedience. \n\nIf someone asks a question to seek self validation and isn\'t ready for possible answers/consequences that\'s not my fault lol \nIt is also not a thing that you have to answer every question with the sense to give the person the answer they are seeking. That has absolutely nothing to do with honesty. If I were to be asked where the next victim by a murderer I\'d probably tell him the address of the nearest police station or call the cops straight away (not taking into account that I am his next victim). \n\nSpouting what\'s on your mind while walking around town also has nothing to do with honesty. It\'s more about self regulation. If asked about someone\'s appearance I don\'t see a single reason to tell them ""what they want to hear"" since most people are looking for positive reinforcement. \n\nI just don\'t see any reason other than survival or avoiding a confrontation/physical violence with people that can\'t control themselves that would prompt a need to lie.', ""It's also incorrect because some of us lie all the time. Me for instance."", 'Yes', 'The thing is most neurotypicals don\'t even differentiate between reality and fantasy.\n\nAs an exemple, today I saw a discussion on the internet where a woman caught her husband speaking with his friends.

The comment section was composed of literally thousands of people saying they just couldn\'t imagine liking someone and not pretending the person was beutiful. As if they have the hability to say something to themselves and just believe it, despite what the truth might be. ""Reality"" for them is whatever they see is more convenient to tell themselves, they have no notion of objective reality.\n\nThis hability to lie to themselves, to know they\'re lying and not see the difference I think it\'s something that will make your internal experience much poorer.

247,Am I the only one who feels guilty everytime I spend any money?,"['spend', 'guilty']",wo222e,43,"[""Similar here, I feel that I clearly don't need much, thus it would be wasteful and glutenous to spend more on things I don't need. And that's fine, you can live an ascetic life. It makes it far easier to walk away from abuse when you don't depend on the money and have savings to help with medical expenses of family members in need, donate to worth causes, etc.\n\nHowever, I would advise you against making similar mistakes that I did in my life. Just because you don't need the money, it doesn't mean you shouldn't take it seriously. If you don't really need it, people will take advantage of you when you negotiate salary at jobs. Over many many years, I found out that I was being paid far less than my peers, despite doing significantly more work.\n\nFor example, in one case, a company once told me that they didn't have any money to pay more, thus that is why the salary was low. When I left the company, the guy who simply took over the systems I created for maintenance (which haven't changed in 5 years) literally had a salary 3 times what I made. I discovered the company had simply been openly and outrageously lying to me.\n\nFurthermore, the respect you get from a company (and often your peers as well) is impacted by your salary. You can literally build a company from the ground up, but as long as your salary is low, they will always view you as a dispensable throw-away employee not worthy to even lick the dirt from their boots.\n\nFight for yourself. You may not have use for the money now, but if you don't fight right now, the cumulative damage you will suffer over the next decade, in terms of lost salary, will get extreme. Be aware that most neuro-typical people lie as a matter of routine.\n\nJust because it's an important topic and lying would cause you a lot of harm, it doesn't mean they care. As far as I can determine, they do not actually believe in loyalty, fairness, justice, truth, or anything else. For most people, there is no such thing as honor, integrity, or principles.

Like, the first searches on Google will tell you that we lack empathy, that we\'re like emotionless robots who can\'t understand a single social clue, who are pretty clumsy, clueless and cold as fuck. Because of that, I delayed my diagnosis for 10 years.\n\nThe first time I came across the possibility of being an aspie was when The Big Bang Theory started to air. Since I was doing my bachelor in engineering physics at the same time, my mom got quite interested in the show to see what could be my daily life as a physicist. And that\'s how she asked me if I thought I could have Asperger\'s. I made a quick search and, for the reasons I mentioned above, we both were like ""nah, it\'s not that bad"". Also, until that point, I always did great in school and had a decent group of friends, but sure I displayed many of the autistic traits. So no one kept digging on the possibility of being on the spectrum.\n\nOnly until I got to graduate school I started to have many issues with executive function. I began to struggle to meet deadlines for my thesis, my anxiety levels got to the roof and I started having seasonal depression. But I always thought I was lazy and undisciplined, and people close to me told me the same. And I managed to finish my masters by brute force.\n\nThen I went for a PhD and I\'m almost there. My depressing cycles got milder, but haven\'t disappeared. And I kept blaming it on laziness. My mom always suggested me to go to a psychologist for therapy, but I didn\'t want to because I kept thinking I was just fucking lazy. Only until a meme on Reddit about ADHD popped up, I thought I had finally found why I was struggling. I went for an assessment and it wasn\'t ADHD. My mom then remembered about the time she suggested Asperger\'s and told me ""duh, you\'re not inattentive nor hyperactive, if anything you have Asperger\'s"". I tried to prove her wrong and went immediately to make a comparative research, and that\'s how suddenly having Asperger\'s made more sense. I made an appointment to be assessed and yeah, it was Asperger\'s.\n\nAbout how to encourage your BF to be assessed, maybe show him some videos of people sharing their experience. One guy that I like is The Aspie World. He puts lots of examples of how Asperger\'s manifest in adults, and your BF might start relating to them.\n\nBut yeah, maybe he avoids the topic because he doesn\'t want to be associated with the Asperger\'s stereotype, which describes us pretty bad many times. I hope this can help both of you!', ""The idea, for a variety of reasons, might make him anxious.  Personally, I got kind of anxious and sad about my ASD diagnosis after I got it because I am th3 sort of person who reads a lot of statistics, and many of the available stats on autistic people don't exactly paint a pretty picture of our quality of life. Even without this, media  portrayals of us are pretty bad, and it is a pretty big change in the way you think about yourself to self diagnose as autistic. \n\nHe also may just not be ready to articulate anything, and depending on how long this has been happening or if it's causing you trouble, it could be fine.

She also had anxiety, depression, ADHD, BPD, C/PTSD, and intrusive thought OCD. Can\'t say whether those all stemmed from her mother wounds but its not a stretch to consider the possibility. None of this was apparent until she started going to therapy.\n\nCombine that all with several asshole partners she had and it was very difficult for her to adjust being with me - while I\'m not the most exciting, spontaneous person, I am kind and understanding and I don\'t lose my temper. However, my atonal delivery of words combined with my flat facial affect made it very difficult for her to gauge my emotional state - she was used to reading people\'s tone and microexpressions in order to make sure everyone was OK and there were no ""threats"". That just didn\'t work for her with me because I mean virtually everything I say whether or not my face changes. I wasn\'t hiding any intentions but even though we were married she couldn\'t ""feel"" concretely that I was being genuine because of how much she relied on her ability to read facial expressions in literally every situation. \n\nHer ADHD also made it very difficult to communicate effectively.

She would also go out of her way to answer a text from someone else in the middle of in-person convo with me which I thought was extremely rude. Sometimes I would just get frustrated and walk away sighing ""ok, nevermind"", which made her mad but my feeling was ""we\'re married, you get my full attention and I don\'t ignore you when you talk to me or need something. Why can\'t I get the same from you?""\n\nI\'m pretty well-adjusted in that even though I prefer routine, when something unexpected or even pretty bad happens, I can roll with the punches, keep a calm head, and do what needs to be done to recover the situation. Her anxiety was so severe that her emotional state was on a hair trigger if anything was outside of what she considered ""normal"" parameters. We had a staggering number of what I think were unnecessary fights stemming from the gas tank being at 1/4 while driving somewhere, in addition to fights about my driving in general, despite that I\'ve taken professional driver training for work and have never been in an accident (guess which one of us had). When buying a house, one of the companies was running behind on their paperwork and her immediate response was ""oh, so we\'re fucked, we won\'t be able to buy the house"" and she meant this, she wasn\'t being sarcastic - no amount of reassurance was going to bring her out of that. Everything ended up fine and I knew it would. \n\nFor these kinds of issues and some other reasons which are out of scope for this discussion, we ended up divorcing after 7 years.\n\nIt may sound like I\'m saying ""avoid people with trauma and mental illness"", but I\'m not. That\'s virtually impossible because we\'ve all got our own shit that we deal with. What I am saying is avoid people who haven\'t done at least some amount of work on their shit and/or been to therapy - self awareness goes a long way. Also, make sure you\'ve done your own work in the same department.

And I brought up adhd because I can‚Äôt focus very well, and my therapist dismissed the idea because I have an eating disorder and he meant that I couldn‚Äôt focus very well due to my ED, and so I agreed. But then I briefly mentioned that autism is very common in my family and he looked at me and was like ‚Äútell me more about it‚Äù so I did tell him about my family and my own experiences and then he gave me an AQ', ""I got diagnosed at 17, if I remember correctly. My parents were pretty sure there was something different about me. I didn't feel that different tbh. Though that's because my parents put a megaton of energy and effort into me. That allowed me to go through school like normal up until early college. It's also because I was able to spaces and time spaces, where I could relax and get energy back from the otherwise tireful days at school.\n\nTLDR: my parents knew I was different, but I didn't.  \n\n\nEDIT: I'm 19 now"", 'I was on a support group on FB for another disorder I had since I was a child. I saw a post of people commenting they also have ASD/autism along with this disorder. I had a pretty stereotypical view of what autism i.e. didn‚Äôt know a lot about it was, thought only males could have it etc etc (I‚Äôm AFAB), so I decided to look it up. A lot of the symptoms were quite fitting, but I still wasn‚Äôt sure. I brought it up to my psychologist and she said that my previous psychologist had suggested I could be autistic. I got referred to see a specialist. This was pretty recent.', '20yo f here. Was diagnose at 19yo. I was seeking therapy for extreme emetophobia and hypochondriac like anxiety. And on top of that my social skills were shit. I was diagnosed with selective mutism at 3 years old and since my social anxiety hardly improved we chalked it up to that but I was speaking with my therapist one day and he said ‚Äúya know, I have a son whose about your age that has aspergers. I wonder if you should get evaluated.‚Äù And at the time I didn‚Äôt know how similar aspergers and autism were. I personally prefer the term aspergers only because if I tell someone I‚Äôm on the autistic spectrum they immediately start talking to me like I‚Äôm a child but if I say aspergers they think ‚Äúoh so she‚Äôs mostly normal‚Äù ü§¶üèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏è but anyway, he referred me to a psychologist that could evaluate me and I went home and researched some ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù of aspergers and low and behold I had most of them. All of these things that I thought were ‚Äújust‚Äù anxiety that I tried so hard to tame and learn to change my whole life were actually uncontrollable autistic traits. My hypochondriac issues were a product of ocd tendencies. My intense fear of vomiting is a fear of losing control. Because my whole life I fought so hard to control my symptoms so no one would think I was weird. I was bullied in school because i didn‚Äôt talk much, I didn‚Äôt have many friends at any point so by the time I reached ninth grade I was homeschooled. Which was bliss because I had so much time to dedicate to learning my special interests. I became obsessed with reptiles and invertebrates. My bedroom is like a zoo five years later and in just the past year that I‚Äôve learned I am indeed on the spectrum, I‚Äôve learned so much about myself and actually changed my own life. Im grateful my therapist decided to say something. I was diagnosed with ‚Äúlevel one ASD‚Äù last year ago and though I definitely have my highs and lows and I definitely still struggle (I don‚Äôt even have a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job because fuck socialization most days) I am genuinely glad i sought a diagnosis.

She had worked with a lot of kids with different diagnoses and she had also noted my behavior as I grew up. Therefore, I felt that she was a trusted source. She told me that I could get it investigated but that there could be consequences and that I should think about it. When I was 17 I realized that it would be 100 times harder to get it investigated after I had turned 18 so I decided to just do it. I got my autism diagnosis about a month before my 18th birthday.', ""I was diagnosed at age 34 (6 months ago.)

Saw someone who specializes in diagnosing adults.\n\nAs to the why of the why? Why I decided to go through the process even though it was causing me lots of anxiety? Eventually the not knowing one way or the other started causing me more anxiety than the potential process/meeting someone new/making appointments was.\n\nIn the end I'm glad I did.  I'm still learning about autism, but as I slowly go through all the memories of my life and now look at it them through the eyes of knowing I have autism it brings a small amount of relief and explanation as to why certain things were difficult or why I acted a certain way or said a specific thing etc."", 'Dunno if you would call 19 late, but here goes. Mostly in the UK it seems to be picked up pretty early.\n\nI got out of the last year of school at 18, got into a uni, got a couple days in and must have had some kind of breakdown. All I can think of caused it is the number of people, having to go through the ""new school"" thing for the 5th time, risking all the crap that would come with being a bit weird again. Plus I couldn\'t imagine sharing, moving etc so I planned to drive it every day, about 30 miles.

Back then we had AOL 3 dialup and googling was a bit of a mission lol. We didn\'t really have much in the way of libraries there either, oddly. Not that we would suspect what to search for anyway.', ""In highschool I developed a weird obsessive habit of tracking everything in my life and all the information I was taking in in school, so that I could ace all my classes ( I lacked any validation and was just constantly chasing after it through grades).

( Ex: organized but failed to prioritize, couldn't tell how much I had to study and therefore studied everything down to the last detail and then realized I had wasted tons of time and sleep learning things I didn't need to. Executive dysfunction, poor auditory processing, etc.) I became visibly visibly sleep deprived, sickly and pale from studying indoors all the time. Probably weirded a lot of teachers out by looking like a total wreck and they encouraged me to get help often. \nEventually one of my psychiatrists finally recognized the typical autistic burnout meltdowns and refered me to a specialist to get diagnosed.

For it to be included on an ASD questionnaire it must be fairly common."", ""What I've noticed is that they don't engage in useless small talk and don't mind just communicating the useful.  Also the fact that we feel different than most people makes it easier for us to relate to someone from another culture and is also different, if that makes any sense"", 'I‚Äôm a Pakistani and most of my relationships are with foreigners (to me) ie westerners / English speakers lol. May be it‚Äôs just an autism thing, feeling more comfortable around ppl from a different culture', 'What you are observing is very common for aspies, and there\'s some interesting research that sheds light on why this may be:\n\n[Communicating in a foreign language takes emotion out of decision-making](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/08/170817141717.htm)\n\nAspies generally are quite terrible at recognizing subtle subtext, emotional overtones, and facial expressions. The automatic language processing that neurotypicals get ""for free"" is basically missing for us, and we are forced to process almost everything at the conscious level, very deliberately. And the logical brain simply isn\'t fast enough to keep up with the firehose of information being transmitted. By focusing on the spoken words and their meaning, we\'re missing at least half of the information being communicated.\n\nHowever, when people are forced to speak in a foreign language, they all have this same disadvantage. They have no choice but to logically think things through word at a time. It slows them down, which also gives that fraction of a second needed for the emotions to not have the final say, and for logic to step up and take center stage in communication.\n\nFor me personally, I found it far easier to fit in among Germans than it ever was in my home country (English speaking). It also helps that German culture tends to be quite detail oriented, focused on specific words with specific meanings, and much less ambiguity. That being said, I still don\'t get along well with Germans who are more artsy and abstract.', 'Yes, and they turn to be aspies as well ü§£üíì', ""I'm in America.

I\'d include people from other English-speaking countries in this too, though. It\'s also part of the reason why I prefer to live outside my ""home"" country (I put that in quotes since I didn\'t grow up there).\n\nI think there\'s a few reasons: one is that they don\'t have such a firm preconception about how someone from my country \\*should\\* behave. Another is that they likely don\'t have an established network of friends locally, so are more open to making new friends. Finally, I\'d guess that people who are willing to leave home and live overseas are more likely to be open-minded and accepting of difference. \n\nI think the OP\'s point of not noticing any slowness or oddness in communication is likely valid too. People from a non-English speaking background might actually \\*appreciate\\* that you speak more slowly, as it can make you easier to understand. (I\'ve had people say this to me...)', 'My friends tend to be older', 'My wife is not a native English speaker. I have thought about this before. She can‚Äôt tell I speak like a robot. We are very happy.', ""I prefer them because the social norms are not fully known to them so they don't judge me. I suspect my dad and uncle are also on the spectrum and they both married foreigners. Being mixed is also an advantage because both ethnic groups consider me a member of the other group, which gives me a little slack."", 'Native english speaker. In college I had two Chinese roommates and I learned VERY quickly to speak with more deliberate diction and with a simpler vocabulary with them so that we could actually communicate effectively. They super appreciated it because they could understand me better than all the other native English speakers they knew and their English got better as a result.\n\nThis skill has translated very well into working for a Japanese company with non-native English speakers from all over the world. I can scale it up or down to match my perception of their skill level (and no, heavy accent does not equate to low English skill. It has to do with vocabulary, familiarity with conversational/informal phrases, ability to understand my ""normal"" English, etc.).\n\nAll that aside I have absolutely found that I\'ve made friends much more easily with people from other cultures.

Had lots of group therapy sessions where people insisted on talking about boundaries. \n\nGranted I was perceived as a dangerous person by my co patients because I can set boundaries easily you have to take my view with a grain of salt I suppose. \n\nMost people there struggled just like you. They cared about people, wanted to comfort everyone around them and always do everyone right. I used to be like that as well and I had to learn the hard way to take care of myself first with lots of emotional damage. Humans are selfish by nature. There are obviously exceptions but I found this to be mostly true. Same for superficial judgements, half arsed assessments of a person and other categorizations without a minimum of information gathering beforehand.\n\nI have found it to be a relief to stand up for myself, my ideals and norms. People who do not fit the bill don\'t get to be close to me (emotionally or conversation wise). By acting on my words people who ""keep it real"" start to recognize you and you start attracting your kind. You will find it a lot easier over time and sometimes it will feel like you\'ve hurt someone but ultimately by setting boundaries and enforcing them you are doing what\'s best for you. I\'ve witnessed people go through that exact process since they\'ve seeked my guidance and all of them said even though they were in conflict with their past (trying to adjust to everyone and making it right by them) they felt a sort of relief. The more often they repeated it, the easier it got and the more they enjoyed it. \n\nIt also has a lot to do with loving yourself. Accept you for who you are and know that whatever you do that it is alright and justified. Hopefully you have a few friends where you can live without boundaries so you get to live the side of you that allows for this idea to be practiced though because you can easily drift off into narcissistic tendencies. \n\nHow exactly you set boundaries? That\'s up to you. Verbally drawing a line is very important so your choice of words has to be precise. Some people need differently strong words in order to understand that you mean business. So be aware of that once you get to the point. You are well within your rights to also not be polite if someone crossed set boundaries and lines but how you deal with that is also your personal choice. \n\nAs you can tell by now, it\'s all about your own desires. A certain amount of self knowledge is required in order to see boundaries successfully as well.', 'You can still be a caring person and have healthy boundaries. A therapist may help you understand why you react the way you do, as without addressing the underlying issue then you may not be able to fix it. \n\nFor ex if the behaviour is based on trauma, it could be fawning https://psychcentral.com/health/fawn-response so in this case you need to address the trauma. \n\nIf it‚Äôs due to social anxiety or fear of judgment, then you need to address your confidence (this is a good book https://www.amazon.co.uk/SELF-COMPASSION-YOURSELF-INSECURITY-Hardcover-May-01-2011/dp/B0053UQ4OS and she‚Äôs great https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/apr/14/ellen-hendriksen-we-are-each-our-own-worst-critic-social-anxiety-disorder-interview). \n\nIf it‚Äôs because you just don‚Äôt know how, there are resources like this https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/six-types-of-boundaries-and-what-healthy-boundaries-look-like-for-each\n\nBasically there isn‚Äôt a one single approach that‚Äôll suit everyone; if very much depends on what‚Äôs driving the issue and you like to approach things.']",https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wo2nxm/how_to_create_boundaries_and_deal_with_people/

280,"I truly, deeply hate myself. (Vent)","['vent', 'hate']",wnn4l6,12,"['Ah, depression, my old friend. We\'ve spent so much time together.\n\nIt\'s ok to vent, it\'s often what\'s needed to begin change. Just knowing that someone out there read what you wrote and gives a damn can go a long way towards helping you know that all is not lost, and that there is still future and hope.\n\nThe first thing to do is to recognize a few basic constraints that life puts upon us, but that can help you guide how to spend your time:\n\n1. You have a lot of years left ahead of you, and you are going to be there and alive, whether you like it or not. The thing that really matters is this: given the hand that life deals you and your current situation, what will you make of each opportunity that happens from now on? This is the only thing you can control, the immediate present, and nothing else. Not the past, not the future.\n2. You are not fully in control of your own body or even your own mind. It pays to ""read the instruction manual"" and learn the basics of how your body works and how your mind works.\n3. Exercising your will is like straining a muscle, you can\'t keep it up very long. The only real way to make long-term change in life is by forming habits that you get into a routine of doing automatically without thinking about them. If you can force yourself to do something consistently for a month or so, it\'ll start sticking and take less effort to keep it going.\n\nNow for some practical ideas:\n\n1. *Weight*: Remember that 1 lb of fat is 3,500 Calories. If you aim for a 500 Calorie deficit per day, then you can lose 1 lb per week. Create a spread-sheet and log what you eat. Go to a [Daily Calorie Intake Calculator](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/calorie-calculator/itt-20402304), figure out what you need daily, and subtract 500, that\'s your new budget. Log each day and record how hungry you feel. You will quickly discover that starchy, fatty, and sugary foods leave you feeling super hungry. To feel more full, you need low-calorie high-fiber high-volume ""treats"" that don\'t cost much against your budget. Carrots, pickles, soup, salads with a tiny bit of sharp cheese, etc. Be realistic too. 6 months of this means 24 lbs, you may need more time.\n2. *Video Games and YouTube*: I\'m sure you\'ve tried to quit several times, but it doesn\'t work that well because it leaves a void. What do you do with your time? You get bored, depressed, frustrated, and then you go back to your old ways. You have to substitute, you can\'t just quit. Start scheduling activities for yourself that have fixed days and hours and put them in your calendar with reminders. Set aside time for looking for a new job, for an online course at Coursera, Udemy, or somewhere else that has a skill you think would make you a better candidate. Set aside time at least 3 times per week to get some exercise. Your neighborhood may have an outdoor park with exercise equipment, and if not, just a long walk can do you good. Pick a place far away that sells a treat you like, like a cookie, walk there, enjoy your treat, and walk back. Do that 3 days a week at least.\n3. *Reach out to those in your network that can help*: Whether you are finding a job, discovering a skill that might land you one, finding a new social group, etc. just a tiny bit of advice from someone can go a LONG way. E.g. time invested randomly applying to places vs. applying to a place where you are recommended by a friend can be very different. Life is hard and finding out even what is going on around you isn\'t easy. Get help when you can.\n\nEach bit of progress will form the foundation of re-building confidence. When you start to see 1 lb drop off each week (approximately), it builds confidence that you set a goal and did it. When you get responses to your job applications (both good and bad), it either gets you a new job or can provide a hint about what skill you are missing and need to acquire.\n\nHow other people treat you will depend a lot on how you view yourself. A lot of people are just barely hanging on themselves, and they feel that they simply don\'t have the capacity to handle other people\'s problems as well. The more confidence you have, or at least if you\'re making progress, the easier it will be to socialize and network as well. If you\'re in a situation where things aren\'t great, but they\'re getting better, that\'s something everyone can sympathize with, and nobody will hold that against you.\n\nLife just happens, it is what it is. Figure out what options you have and where you can be in 1 or 2 years. When you think through the options, you may be surprised what can be done with small daily efforts piled up over long periods of time.', ""That sounds like a difficult situation to deal with, and even though you're not being as successful in your struggles as you need to be I do respect the work that you've done\n\nI have seen that sometimes we can't succeed properly in the systems around us, and I don't feel that this makes us less worthwhile so much as it shows us where we can't succeede properly in the systems around us\n\nAre you a member of any gaming communities, or is that something you could be interested in?

During elementary school, I didn\'t have to make friends. One teacher had her son in my same classroom, she told him to be my friend, and it worked.

But those other people aren't inclined to play nice socially with us now, because we haven't built those alliances.\n\nThe good news is, although we weren't naturally born to those skills; we can improve on them with some deliberate effort and conscious thought directed at those things that come naturally for others."", 'Charisma on Command (excellent YouTube channel for improving charisma) has an excellent video on this. \n\nInterpersonal communication isn\'t exactly a concrete science, so this hasn\'t been hard proven. It makes sense from a psychological perspective though and seems to be a pretty accepted idea.\n\n\nLet\'s pretend there are multiple conversations happening or multiple people talking, vying for attention. \nYou say something and it gets passed over. No one responds or gives attention to what you said.\nIf you stop here, it signals to people that what you had to say was not important. They will continue like nothing happened and be more prone to ignore your input if there\'s other stuff happening.\n\n\nWhat you want to do is get people\'s attention and then repeat what you said, or repeat what you said until it gets a reaction. There can be some nuance on how to do this successfully, because if you sit there repeating the same thing in a quite voice over and over, you will seem crazy. \nSome general tips would be to say it louder (don\'t shout though, but play the loud game. Compete at the volume of the others there) or target a specific person by locking eyes with them when you say it or putting a hand on their shoulder while you say it.\nAlternatively, instead of repeating it louder, grab attention with a phrase like, ""listen to this,"" ""hey, how about this,"" ""hear me out."" Repeating these is less strange than just repeating what you wanted to say. If you don\'t get attention after once or twice, use the same idea of raising your voice a bit or targeting an individual. \nEven if people don\'t agree or like your idea or whatever, they won\'t be as likely to consider your entire input and everything you might say as ignorable. \n\n\nIn the Charisma on Command video, I forget who the example of repeating yourself until you\'re heard is, but use a good clip of Kevin Heart getting ignored and then going, ""Listen. Listen."" Then he inserts himself physically more into the center and says ""Listen listen listen,"" basically forcing attention on him. He then says his thing and everybody laughs. It was a relatively relaxed, social situation/interview as opposed to a board room. \n\n\nThis information is useful to everyone, not just people with aspergers. Some NTs figure it out naturally but many still learn it from a source. \nI am extremely social and love talking. I\'m from a loud family that frequently gets louder as the energy increases at a family gathering, talking over each other and vying to get in the joke or defend ourself in a story or such. Learning this has helped me in those situations as well. \nMy dad is an only child and quite introverted, so he prefers to watch on the sideline and insert his bit less frequently, but I\'ve realized he\'s always been pretty good at choosing his moment or taking attention using these techniques (at least since I\'ve been alive).\n\n\nSlipping in a quick edit to mention, I\'m not saying this is a good thing or a fair system or anything. Just genuinely trying to explain why it seems to me that people with aspergers would be more likely to be ignored, and hopefully offer a tip and a resource (Charisma on Command, loads of excellent videos I rewatch at least every 2 years or so) to increase everyone\'s odds at being heard and taken more seriously as a source of input.', 'I am also distraught by this phenomenon.

For some reason, there are a lot of people, mainly at my job, that will see me talking with someone and they will just come right in and interrupt our conversation. Sometimes they‚Äôll quickly say sorry but then continue with talking, like I‚Äôm not even there. Sometimes I will wait until they‚Äôre done and other times I‚Äôll just walk away. But I‚Äôve noticed an uptick in this behavior over the last several months. Maybe I‚Äôm just more aware of it now. But I find it extremely rude, whether it happens to an aspie or not.

Are you rich? Are you powerful? Are you dangerous? Are you an important social ally or asset to be associated with? Do you have something to offer that these people want? If no, then you are probably low on the social hierarchy and that is why people don\'t give any attention.\n\nAlso though many people are just plain rude.', ""They think I'm annoying or say things there not interested in \n\nOnly others with my like minded Ness have really listened to me especially when I did presentations the yeach had to yell at kids to pay attention while they would for other presenters"", ""I've done public speaking and stagework.

They switch to a subject that completely breaks the ""flow"" of conversation and seem unaware of the non-verbal ques that communicate to them that the other people want to move on to another subject. This leads to people getting frustrated and just talking over them.\n\n2. Tone/volume. Talking in a very flat way or at a too low volume can bore people or make them feel unengaged with the conversation. This can lead to them switching to a separate conversation with people next to them.\n\n3. Overall non-verbal communication. Stuff like looking people in the eyes (but not all the time), posture, facial expressions. Doing it right keeps people engaged, doing it wrong will (again) make people feel like they\'re not part of the conversation and you\'re just mumbling to yourself.\n\n4. Keeping it interactive. Give people breaks to interrupt, share their experiences or opinions, or completely change the subject if they\'re done talking about the current subject. This does depend on the context of the conversation though, sometimes (presentations etc) it\'s expected that you\'re the only one talking of course. Not giving people the opportunity to be part of the conversation will effectively make it a monologue. People will lose interest or get annoyed.

We were all playing outside when I had wandered too far out into the street then BAM! A large red truck launches me like a rag-doll and I go flying. I didn\'t initially feel the pain, I was really just in shock for the most part. I remember everyone freaking out and seeing my drunk cousin trying to fight the dude that was driving the truck (it was a family event so there was a lot of drinking going on). I had broken 3 ribs (none of which punctured my lungs thankfully), a broken collar bone, orbital bone fracture, and a major concussion. By the time the ambulance had gotten there and they had put me on the stretcher, I could feel that I was already fading. Now up until this point, my family has raised me Catholic and being only 11, my entire perception of death was going to heaven and seeing a light and all the other biblical stories because it\'s all I\'ve ever been told. But watching everything fade to black made me internally panic and my immediate thought was ""hell"" because dark is the opposite of light. And then suddenly, everything ceased. Literally everything that ever was just left. There was nothing. No light, no dark, no matter, no feeling, no happiness, no sadness, no mad, no confusion. It was a place where not even nothing was there. And the feeling of ""      "" was the most peaceful feeling of all. Absolutely nothing. My mom told me I was dead for about 2-3 minutes.

I told them straight up that I didn\'t see anything. Oh, that pissed them off lol. The event was really big for them and it sort of created an unevenness in my family. Even today, my family doesn\'t believe my story and convinced themselves into believing I didn\'t die and I only pretended. The only person that believes my story is my mom and she stopped taking me to church and I don\'t have good contact with that side besides seeing them once a year.

""God"", as many conceptualise him, does not exist.\n\nLet me explain this, by ""God"" I assume you mean the one identified as such in Jewish, Muslim and Christian conceptions. And in all three he is considered as the creator of all that exists, the physical laws, energy, matter and in general what is encompassed in space-time ... and there is the reason for my first concept, because ... how can ""exist"" something that is what gives ""existence"" to everything, let\'s take the following example, imagine the universe outside, a painting on a canvas, ok ? what exists inside that painting will ask, where is the creator of the painting ? and again it is a meaningless question because, the painter was alien to the painting, and the painting and all that exists inside it cannot directly know something that is outside of it, because for the painting, itself is the whole universe.\n\nNow let\'s do another exercise, painting is not something static when it is in its process of elaboration, those who are artists will tell you that they conceptualise it, they draw possibly models of the parts and then little by little they add elements to it, sometimes they can even change representations, eliminate them or leave them unfinished and then use the parts of that unfinished painting for a work totally different to the one originally thought ... not a few artists end up drawing something totally different even. Now you, as one of the elements of that painting (universe), how could you ""know"" that ? for you there is the growth of a part, then its change or destruction, then times in which everything remains static, then moments in which more and more colours, characters, colourful, macabre, dire, happy, sad elements appear ... and some in the painting (universe) begin to ""theorize"" why this happens ... some speak of one or several external all-powerful entities that can modify the painting (Universe) to their liking, others that they are random events products of an existing framework of the existence of the painting (Universe), some may try to predict what these all-powerful entities will do.\n\nNow there are concepts within the paint that can give you clues as to whether or not there is a creator, these ""manifestations"" can be the product of one or more creators, but they will also depend a lot on what those who ""live"" in that ""painting"" understand.\n\nNow returning to our reality, what we know at least in our universe, that this has been formed, to the point that... there are creatures within it that can observe it, conceptualize it, analyze it... but they have also gone through periods in where they have consciously and unconsciously destroyed what exists around them... And that would throw up the question if the universe has been formed to the point that... there is ""something"" in which it can be observed, studied, understood?\n\nTherefore the question(s) regarding that which is known as ""God"" is not something that I or humanity can say if ""it is"" or ""it is not""... what I know is that there will still be a multitude of questions , theories, points at which science can end up explaining it, philosophy can theorize possibilities, nature reminds us again that we are just one more point of possible things in the universe that can cease to exist ... but later with more time (since we are not omniscient, we need time to learn) humanity is closer to a concrete answer to the question(s) related to ""God"".', 'I believe in God but recognize that it is not proven, and should stay the fuck out of all things related to politics, and should be completely separate from government, and we should never use the Bible as a reason for political decisions', 'So I grew up in a conservative Catholic household.. religion was always shoved down our necks.. we were expected to believe and surrender to god but I never did..

With the invention of agriculture, people had much more free time to do more highly specialized jobs such as metalworking, weaving, and so on. don\'t get me wrong, some of those things (to some extent) happened in tribal societies back in the day (and continue to happen in tribal societies in the modern day). But the sheer availability of food available from agriculture and the reduced need for every member of the group to actively participate in food gathering allowed for drastically improved specialization in other crafts to be mechanically possible.  \n\n\nBecause of this growing division of labor (Farmers, crafters, soldiers, rulers, merchants) and so on, wealth inequality began to grow, and grow rapidly, as cities states began to form. These city states invariably started to develop legal courts, and systems of law enforcement, that while crude by modern standards, would be recognizable by people living in our era.   \n\n\nFor example, the oldest known written legal code is the Code of Hammurabi, from about 1790-ish BC. It contains provisions for things like punishments for stealing, how to divorce a spouse, and so on.   \n\n\nEventually, the rulers of these cities states came up with a really clever population control method. Rather than relying on the physical presence of enforcers such as police to enforce order (and maintain their despotic, exploitative rule) they invented religion instead.  \n\n\nReplacing the shamans, and medicine women, was the priestly castes. People who\'s job was to declare that the king\'s rule was divinely sanctioned. People who\'s job was to convince the lower classes that the unjust system they lived in, was actually fair somehow. A major way to trick the lower classes into accepting the unfairness of the nations they lived in, was to promise eternal rewards and punishments, with the rewards promised to those who obediently protected the status quo that the ruling class wanted, and the punishments promised to those who disobey the ruling class/agitated rebellion against the ruling class.   \n\n\nAnd that system worked for quite some time as a polytheistic thing, until eventually a heretical splinter group of Judaism called ""Christianity"" became the official, (legally mandated) religion of the Roman Empire, and all of the control methods used by prior polytheistic faiths were ruthlessly used by the Roman Catholic church\'s efforts to control the western world.  \n\n\nAnd then this thing called ""The renaissance"" happened and some splinter groups called Protestants broke off of the Roman Catholic church, (which is entirely unimportant for this story) and secular humanism as a philosophy of political governance began to take hold in the west (China had developed it\'s own rough equivalent to humanism, albeit less secular, and more religious around the 6th-5th century BC, about two centuries before. You might have heard of it. It\'s this little thing called Confucianism)  \n\n\nAnd in a very similar time period to the renaissance, European explorers discovered the rest of the goddamn world (and by discovered, I mean from their perspective, as in general there were already people living in most of the places they found)   \n\n\nAnd during said discovery, the Europeans encountered more groups that practice various tribal religions, as well as other branches of the Abrahamic tradition (such as Islam) and of course, Hinduism (which is still very polytheistic) and Buddhism (which is sometimes atheistic spiritualism, but sometimes also is theistic spiritualism, and is sometimes practiced by itself, and is sometimes practiced as a side religion)   \n\n\nAnd upon learning (in rather broad strokes) about the rest of the world, and eventually learning enough about archeology to get a sensible notion of the history of humanity,  \n\n\nMany people in the world of academia (not just Europeans, or of European descent) pieced together the timeline of the history of religion that I just laid out for you.   \n\n\nAnd while many of them (to this day) ignore the mountains of evidence that show that religion is a man-made social construct used by rich people, to control poor people.....  \n\n\nA lot of people (such as myself) look at that mountain of historical, archeological evidence, stack that next to every lick of everything we know about the origins of the universe, and evolution, and say  \n\n\n**""The single best supported hypothesis as to the origin of the concept of god, or the divine, or any supernatural claims whatsoever is that they are all human inventions used to control other humans.

We have to accept at a certain point that we don‚Äôt know everything, and by the intricate design we see in nature, we can (if we subconsciously allow it and consciously choose to) deduce that our world isn‚Äôt here just by accident. \n\nIn Physics, if you know about observers, particle-wave duality, and wave function collapse, the behavior of light waves/ particles changes based on whether there is someone observing the phenomena. Like the common question ‚Äúif a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around to see it, did it really make a sound?‚Äù, we must have been there to actually say first-hand that the tree did make a sound. Also, a thought experiment I performed involved a basic room with a light switch. If there is a chair sitting in the room with a light on, and I turn the lights out, based on what light waves are present (none), we can‚Äôt say for sure that a chair is in the room without trying to touch it or assuming it‚Äôs there because it was a few seconds prior. If you stand still, because of the lack of light, whether the chair technically exists is based on whether the particles that make up the chair are seen by me (an observer). We need light waves present and someone observing the object (particles) to say for sure it exists. The same goes with our own existence. If we spend all our time in the dark figuratively, how can we ever really be for sure of what exists beyond our own intelligence?\n\nAlso, doesn‚Äôt that beg the question, what if the only way we exist (our particles that make us up and the light waves that bounce off of us) is because there are light waves present on Earth while humankind is the object (particles) that would need an observer to say every single one of us exists.? Wouldn‚Äôt we too need an observer that is outside of our realm of ‚Äúexistence‚Äù for us to even ‚Äúexist‚Äù.\n\n\nAside from some personal experiences that supersede questioning God‚Äôs existence, I still can view it as more of a risk to believe theories than to take a leap of faith into becoming a Christian.

Now, I am reading the Bible (again, just as an older adult) and I simply don‚Äôt believe a majority of self proclaimed Christians read this shit, because if they did, they‚Äôd be horrified.

Have you had therapy? As there are various techniques one could learn to manage intrusive thoughts. \n\nIn any case, meditation is your best bet, if you can‚Äôt get therapy. The point is not to stop the thought, but to learn not to pay attention (he explains it well https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=n6pMbRiSBPs). \n\nWhen you meditate, you generally get something to focus on. I do it with mala beads, so each bead is an in/out breath, or just the breath. When the mind starts wondering, then I notice and redirect back to the breath, with no judgement or frustration. And initially I had to do this every few seconds, then it‚Äôs less and less. It‚Äôs like training any muscle through repetition. \n\nI don‚Äôt have OCD but I have GAD and sometimes my mind gets stuck too, so instead of fighting with it and trying to stop it, I acknowledge it ‚Äúthere goes the GAD‚Äù and then I go do something else or if I can‚Äôt, I do this a couple of times https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rBdhqBGqiMc.

I‚Äôm usually done in a day. \n\nIf you move school, you‚Äôd be giving in to the rumination and make it way more powerful than it needs to be. It is obviously up to you, but l‚Äôd personally use this as an opportunity to learn how to manage intrusive thoughts.', ""It is very difficult sometimes to get past a powerfully unpleasant event, especially when we are the one‚Äôs at fault. I understand exactly what you are saying, how it just replays and replays in the brain, coloring life, making us angry, and sad, and frustrated all at the same time, sometimes for days or weeks.\n\nA couple of things:\n\nFirst, let me tell you that as you grow older, these occurrences grow less powerful, and less persistent. You may have such events happen for your entire life (because we all continue to make mistakes and feel bad about them our whole lives) but they won‚Äôt be so deeply affecting or long-lived, the older you get.\n\nSecond, there are mental techniques that can help with the pain and persistence in the present. What I‚Äôve learned to do over the years when I make a mistake and I find its ruining my life with persistent negative emotion is that I deal with any necessary actions that need to be made in response to my error asap (for example by apologizing to the person I wronged), and then I forgive myself as the fallible human being that I am, and accept the entire incident as a learning experience to guide me in the future.\n\nI‚Äôll give you a real example from my life: Recently I was scammed by a very shady company into giving them money for a service that they never fully provided and since it was an internet thing, I was left with no way to contact them to fight them. I didn't do my due diligence when choosing them to do business with and paid a significant price for my laziness.\n\nI was furious when it happened, and it was all I could think about‚Äî their criminal behavior and my stupidity in trusting them. I felt like shit. I realized quickly that if I couldn‚Äôt find a way to move past the anger that it would consume me for way too long. So I decided to do 2 things: First, I limited myself to 3 hours to try to hunt down their information on the internet, to perhaps find some way to communicate with them, but if I was unable to find anything after three hours, then I decided I would chalk the entire financial loss up as the cost of learning a life lesson on being careful with one‚Äôs business dealings.\n\nNeedless to say, I couldn‚Äôt discover any way to reach them, so I reiterated to myself it was a price I had to pay for that lesson, but now I‚Äôve learned it, and I could then just let it drop.\n\nI haven‚Äôt worried about my financial stupidity and their criminality since that moment. Karma will get them one day. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm mentally whole and healthy, not raging or worrying about it.\n\nI hope my experience will help you too. Events like the one that happened with you the other day are simply life lessons that everyone has, embrace your own humanity, forgive yourself and move forward. If you feel someone owes you an apology, you can tell them how you feel, but if they refuse, then once again, chalk it all up as a life lesson and move forward."", 'From different events, I\'ve had similar memories that have crept in and keep sporadically haunting me and causing embarrassment even 20 years later. However, as u/Ccornutus noted, the memories do become less frequent and less intense with time.\n\nI think the reason why this memory is sticking out so strongly in your brain is because there\'s more going on than just a simple joke that went wrong. The problem is that there is an increasing distance developing between yourself and your peers. What seemed like a silly prank that people would have laughed at when your were younger has suddenly turned into a grave offense.\n\nIt leads you to start wondering. What happened? Why is this simple act of playfulness suddenly treated as if I were some kind of monster? Am I so out of touch that a friend would have to yell at me over something I didn\'t even know was offensive? Where did this gulf of misunderstanding come from and when did it even form?\n\nMiddle school is an especially difficult time for us Aspies. A huge reason for this is that for neuro-typical people, that age range is when several new areas of the brain are coming online. The obvious one is an increased awareness of sexuality, but the significantly more impactful one is an increasing awareness of social-hierarchy. Basically, neuro-typical people start becoming aware of their position in a ""pecking order"", who\'s more popular than who, who should hang out with who, etc.\n\n[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52211-8](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-52211-8)\n\nHowever, this is something that we don\'t get as Aspies. In many ways, our adolescent years are very much the same as the years before. We\'re like big little-kids. We get bigger and stronger, more intelligent, and sophisticated, but we\'re still following the same rules and beliefs that we did before.\n\nThis is not true with almost everyone else, however. To most of your peers, they will start paying a LOT more attention trying to size themselves up against each other in various ways: clothing, who they hang out with, choices of movies/books/etc., how they physically look, physically attacking and fighting those they deem weaker, and on and on and on.\n\nWhat most likely happened is that your friend was trying to rebuke you for engaging in behaviors now deemed ""childish"", and that they are now too mature for.\n\nWhen I was a little kid, I would literally knock on people\'s doors and if there was a kid my age, I\'d just ask if they wanted to play. Well that doesn\'t work so great once you get a bit older, and it\'s the same for a wide variety of other issues.\n\nThis gap between neuro-typical and aspies will only continue to grow, and reach it\'s peak around 18 or so, and then it make take you a decade or two to learn the new social rules that everyone else seemed to magically know. It can feel like you somehow missed the memo.\n\nFor this, I have two pieces of advice:\n\n1. The fact that you actually know you have Aspergers is a HUGE benefit. I had no clue at your age and nobody lifted a finger to help. I recommend reading the book: [https://www.amazon.com/Been-There-Done-That-This/dp/1849059640](https://www.amazon.com/Been-There-Done-That-This/dp/1849059640)  \nIt can help a lot mostly because it explains what is going on with everyone else. You already know your own brain, you need help understanding the brains of others.\n2. Find a school club/group that focuses on a particular activity that you enjoy. It can be computer programming, crafting, math tournaments, art, etc. It\'s MUCH easier to make new friends when you have a common age-appropriate interest.\n\nI hope this helps! I know it would have helped me when I was your age.', ""Better health leads to better stress tolerance.

Yeah, I still get bored with it pretty fast, but other people can be pretty great if you give them a chance. You can study them like you study your interests, as long as you‚Äôre measured about it, and it will make you closer to them. \n\nBest of luck !', 'Couple of questions.

This can include situations like people taking credit for your work. You can be undercut by those who view you as competition, for example, people can claim ""ownership"" of a given domain or subject, force all decisions to go through meetings which they control the attendance of, and things can get way out of hand before you even realize what\'s going on.\n\nIn addition to people taking credit for your work or sabotaging what you do, you are also vulnerable to people blaming their mistakes on you. It\'s quite easy for them to do, because in a work environment, a lot of decisions are not rational, but rather the personal relationships matter a great deal in how people perceive facts. So while you work like a dog saving the company from destruction, someone else can be spending all day socializing with the higher-ups, and have a dominant voice in determining who to believe when they finally enact their schemes.\n\nIf you aren\'t aware of what\'s going on, you can end up with several concrete consequences:\n\n* Far greater working hours than anyone else.\n* Lower pay.\n* Isolation from social events.\n* Exclusion from decision making.\n* Outright threats of termination, abusive language, bullying, etc.\n\nTo make matters worse, those who appoint themselves in charge of promoting diversity and inclusion can often end up piling on top of you as well.

Unfortunately this will not always work because people are different even if they had the same upbringing and there is no real foolproof formula that is going to work for everyone  \nAge will also play into this, late teens to early-mid 20s people are just balls of hormones and instinct and rarely look for an actual partner beyond what is required for mating. The drive to \'be with someone\' is higher and more intense as our biology drives us to procreate. Dating is not a means to find a compatible partner, but more of a competition to convince someone to carry your seed. This could also be more male centered than female centered as I have only observed this competition in male hetero and homo relationships and can\'t speak for female views on this. In this case a formula to copulate would probably have better results with people, especially males.\n\n  \nThen you can also fail due to the fact that women are not as easy to figure out as you think, from an early age they have to deal with shit from men and even with biology screaming at them they will be putting you on a Danger meter.

I just accepted that I was never going to have a relationship, and that it didn\'t even matter what I did, because even if I did meet someone, it would only be a matter of time before they ""found out"" that I\'m really worthless and not worthy of them.\n\nAt this point, I simply stopped caring. I didn\'t care what people were going to think about me, because I ""knew"" that they were going to hate me anyway. But to people outside of my own head, I basically started to appear more confident and ""normal"". I was no longer afraid to talk to random people, and I would just talk about whatever the heck I felt like, politics, religion, philosophy, all the things people say not to talk about, but that I actually cared about. What others perceived as confidence was simply me having given up on any hope that someone would do anything other than simply hate me no matter what I said.\n\nIt was this that ironically started the change. I started up a conversation with a total stranger by cracking a joke during a delayed train, making up stories for why the train got delayed, ranging from a damsel in distress being tied to the rails, to the train stopping because a school of ducklings had to move across the tracks.

But this time, they did call, and when they asked what I wanted to do, I wanted to explore the city I was in, visit historic grave yards, etc. In fact, I didn\'t even realize I was in a relationship at all until quite late into it.\n\nThe point of all this is something I didn\'t realize early on. You don\'t actually know what\'s in other people\'s heads. Some people will hate you, other people will not. The only way to know is to talk to people. Depending on where you live, there\'s different ways to just start talking to people. It might be something like meeting people through online dating, religious services, [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) groups on a topic you like, or simply going to a local park every Saturday morning to go on a long walk.\n\nBut pick something you you actually want to do and will enjoy, but also has other people around. Even so, the chances of meeting someone are low, but a whole lot better than isolation.

Your situation prompts me to say something, as I am grappling with the aftermath of my own struggle with identity and purpose. When I started 10 years ago at your age, I did not have an education, career, experience, friends, children, or a relationship. I thought all of these experiences and bonds would be beyond me from how different I was from everyone I knew. How little I knew how much would change over the course of life itself. And that‚Äôs the key: learning to live and take in the experiences and using our condition in our way, not the way society expects of us necessarily. The NTs in your life have gone a different path, but there are still ways to bond with them, just from shared experiences, even if we prefer our own company much of the time. And there is a whole community of Aspies like us that relate to your challenges, struggles, experiences, and opportunities. I cannot ease your fears or emotions, but I can give you my reflection of my past, and see if it applies in your case. I cannot say time heals all things, but I can say it gives the opportunity to experience and shape us and in turn we can shape it.', 'I can‚Äôt do anything more than speculate, but, based on what you describe here, you may be a strong candidate for ADHD. The boredom, brain not under your control, struggles in school, difficulty with functioning are common symptoms for it. And they‚Äôre finding now that many, many people with ASD also fit the criteria for ADHD. You may want to look into getting evaluated. I won‚Äôt say ADHD meds will change your life, it‚Äôs entirely subjective; but ADHD has proven to be more treatable with its meds than some other conditions.', ""It'll get better.  Might take ten years, but you'll figure yourself out eventually.  Your brain is not done developing. The executive function that you lack in order to actualize your potential is probably the last thing that will kick in. That's the way it seems to work for us. Expect to get your s*** together and your late twenties or early 30's.  Assuming, that you don't give up anyways."", 'Your post is so well written.  You‚Äôve really summed yourself up there.  You might want to take it to a proper professional & get some ideas on coping, brain control, ‚Äòrisk taking‚Äô, ( I‚Äôve had a hellofa time with that one myself) ~ the superiority, acting out‚Ä¶ just all of it.\n\nI have never checked out as hard as two years but I sure hear where you‚Äôre coming from.', 'There are many possible causes for why you feel the way you do, and those of us who are not in your shoes can only venture a guess. Below is my guess, and I hope that it proves to be useful to you.\n\nIn your description of your thoughts, attitudes, and actions, the common thread that I see is a short time frame in which you think ahead and plan your actions. If someone makes you mad, you react now. If you feel you were more intelligent, you reacted now in terms of how you treated school work. This may feel perfectly reasonable as well, because you live in the now, what other possible time frame would one think from?\n\nThankfully you are only 19, and you have a lot of options remaining. I wish I had as many years left in me as you do, and I wish I spent fewer of my years learning life lessons from the school of hard knocks.\n\nOne thing I eventually figured out was that, in order to properly think further ahead and gain some structure in my life, I needed a purpose. Logic alone is useless for this. Logic will help you get from point A to point B following fully rational and connected steps. However, why begin with A? Why bother trying to get to B? Using logic alone, there isn\'t even a reason to get up in the morning or to even continue to live.\n\nPurpose is something you only have partial control over. You can try to use your logical brain to convince yourself that you must do X or Y, but deep down, there\'s a much more stubborn part of you that NEEDS certain things in life. That inner voice doesn\'t really speak loudly or clearly, but it will keep clawing at the back of your mind and make you miserable unless you take it into account. That voice doesn\'t really go away, it\'s part of who you are, so it\'s best to become aware of what it wants.\n\nThe trick that helped me personally was to plan backwards. Start with this mental experiment:\n\nImagine that you are an old man/woman at the end of your years. Looking back on your life, what would you consider as something that makes you worthy of those years you had on Earth? What would be your biggest regret?\n\nFor me personally, my biggest fear was being just another mouth to feed, a burden on others. The thing that I really wanted more than anything was to advance humanity, to make something possible that was never possible before, so that even after I die, my life would have had some meaning. It is a round-about way to cheat death, to live on after you die.\n\nFor you, it may be different. Maybe you care about how people will remember you after you\'re gone. Maybe you care about leaving behind a legacy, children, etc. Maybe you care about the overall weight of good deeds vs. bad deeds, that you lived an honorable life. For everyone, this will be different. But find a quiet place, ideally in nature, outside and away from distractions to think through what you want out of life before you die.\n\nOnce you have a goal in mind, the next step is go backwards from that goal. In my case, I want to make an impact, I want to accomplish something. Well, do do that, I need control over where my time goes, that is, I need time to work on things. But to get time, I need to not slave away 12 hours a day working for someone else\'s goals, meaning I need financial independence. To get financial independence, I need to create a business, that is, be able to benefit from the fruits of my labor for years like my employers do, rather than slaving away every day and owning nothing. To have a business, I need a product to sell. To have a product, I need time to build it and a good idea.\n\nNow I\'m at the level that I can start breaking down tasks into things I can do on a daily basis. I can schedule 1 hour per day to explore forums, listen to people\'s complaints, see if there\'s an opportunity for a product/business. I can schedule 3-4 hours each weekend day attempting to either learn a necessary skill to build that product, or attempt to build it.\n\nThe goal here is to make goals concrete enough so you can form a schedule around them, put appointments for yourself on the calendar. Why bother with this? Because it\'s freaking hard to get yourself to do anything by will-power alone. It\'s so much easier to get distracted by games or videos online or to just zone out. You want to make these activities into a routine that you ""just do"" out of habit rather than forcing yourself to do them.\n\nAlmost any major project or goal you have in life is going to get done not in one big go, but bit by bit, hundreds of accumulated hours of effort spread over many many days. Whether this is completing online courses, sending out applications to colleges, finding a better job for day-to-day expenses, etc.\n\nMost of all, keep your eyes open for opportunities and learn from failures. E.g. if you apply for a job and get rejected, find out why. Was there a skill or experience you were lacking? Could you gain that skill via an internship, community college, or online course? Do you have the per-requisite background skills? Every failure can add goals into that pipeline that you can break down into day-to-day routines.\n\nAnd don\'t beat yourself up for failures. Life\'s a marathon, it\'s not a sprint. Pace yourself, learn how much focus you can squeeze out of your brain per day, work with what you have, and by exercising it, your capacity will grow over time. Focus itself is a muscle you have to train.', 'Similar story here, though I‚Äôm currently twice your age. It does get better. Just take care of yourself no matter what. Shower every day, eat healthfully, and exercise. Things will get better and you‚Äôll find your own path.', 'Same early story here. The only difference is now I love being happy. Keep living life.

Like not the method of getting there, but the general around it","['movies', 'guy']",wlvuea,42,"['In my opinion,\n\nIn the pre-disney star wars, after the Empire crumbled there was a galactic space locust invasion or something of that ilk.  I think it was Han and Lea\'s kid that led the defense and the Republic barely survived.  I think death and suffering was on a scale vastly outclassed by the oppression of the Empire\n\nFrom what I understand, this is the lesson of the canon, yes the Empire is bad, but bad compared to what?  Half the galaxy being eaten and destroyed?  The republic, because of the inaction due to human nature of ""this isn\'t affecting me yet, so I won\'t act on it"", meant that they didn\'t have a unifying solid defense.\n\nIf the Empire had still existed, they could have stopped the invasion and saved more planets and people.\n\nI think the lesson is that everything doesn\'t have to be all left or all right, what is needed is what they constantly talk about, balance.  Sith and Jedi are equally bad.  The true path is the grey Jedi, the balance of light and dark.\n\nFor Star Trek, there\'s just so much lore there we would have to pick a specific circumstance.  Let\'s pick something from our own world.  A pre-industrial society without modern medicine meets and industrial society.  Modern medicine means that most of the babies will now live, so they have in the next generation a population explosion, there isn\'t enough jobs and food to sustain that population, so they must leave, live in the gutter, or die.\n\nThe parents don\'t know how to teach the kids what to do because everything changed so fast and all their skills that they learned have been outstripped by technology.  So kids have no guidance.\n\nWith the new found industrial wealth also comes the crime, the drugs, the constant need for instant gratification.\n\nSomeone visiting a rural place like this and helping to industrialize them might return in 25 years to find all the people they tried to help are homeless, jobless, and living in abject poverty.\n\nStar Trek is the lesson for us to not just go in to a society and change everything and say ""our way is right"".  It shows the ramifications of doing so.\n\nLastly, Spiderman really is about people struggling with mental health, they aren\'t evil, they are people and they are sick.

The original Star Wars movies had pretty clear good guys and villains. It was only when the sequels came out and tried to give more depth that they inadvertently made the Empire the good guys. Star Trek in trying to keep things simple and utopian actually created a utopia in that it‚Äôs a set up that can‚Äôt exist. In that too the original was better because it was more limited.

We would have been better off militarily if all that effort had been redirected to close in air support instead.\n\nEach movie to come out makes the rebellion seem more daft, and the Empire seem more reasonable, and it becomes clear that the movie franchise is being run by an imperialist force that certainly doesn't want the moviegoers public questioning its motives or methods.\n\nThe Disney Empire was noted for its aggressive money-hungry habits long before it aquired Star Wars.

Sure, the *Empire* provided jobs. Vader provided jobs to...inquisitors/bounty hunters to hunt down Jedi? His motivations are clearly stated in the movies: He\'s after power, he wants to rule the galaxy. I don\'t think ""giving back to the community"" tops his list haha. \n\nNeither side is perfect, and there are some obvious problems with the Jedi (like you stated). But the Sith are portrayed as operating entirely out of self-interest (with the possible exception of Maul-Savage). It\'s like, in their code. As for their respective crimes, sure the Jedi committed some war crimes. But our introduction to the Empire/Sith, right out of the gate, is them *blowing up an entire planet* just to prove a point. Like how can you come away from that thinking they\'re the good guys?\n\nI mean, Hitler provided jobs, helped create an economic boom for Germany, and unified the country.

I have moderate autism and extreme ADHD.  I find that people get angry at the questions I ask because when I don\'t understand something, it comes across as me questioning them as a person, as they have tied up their opinions into their sense of worth and personality.  I have learned to just not ask questions when something is being explained, and then wait until I do the task and then ask for help.\n\n2.  I find people aren\'t saying what they think they are saying.  They learn words by people talking, and the definition of those words is what they understand from their conversations.  I learn words the same way, and then confirm the definition in a dictionary, and use that definition.\n\nSecondly, English is a tonal and body language.\n\nSo when someone says, with a straight face and a normal tone, while facing you with their arms at their sides, and their feet facing forwards, looking  you in the eye: ""Ya, I am totally going to do that"", means ""I will do that"".\n\nWhereas, someone with smirk on their face, a sarcastic tone, facing partially away from you, arms crossed, feet facing to the side, just glancing at you, and then close their eyes when they say ""Ya, I am totally going to do that"", means ""I will not do that"".\n\nSo when you mix people using different tones, with body language, and their perceived definition of words, you can get phrases like the following:\n\n""Well then I told buddy he could f right off"" - maybe means: ""That person was being ridiculous so I bid them a good day and excused myself""\n\n""You\'re so bad"" - maybe means: ""I love this, please continue""\n\n""I am literally going to kill myself later"" - maybe means: ""I am having a bad day"".\n\nYou have to learn the tone and the body language to understand the true meaning of the statements.', ""My 16 year old started out with asbergers now autism.

I think, unlike some other respondents, that the situation can change in the long run, however that depends on our fight to make it so. Yes, we are a minority, but many other people have similar problems in many situations, they just happen to have better tools to deal with them by default, so by standing up for a better situation for ourselves we might find that the specific changes / accomodations, although they seem at first only good for a minority, may become a majority position. (As an example: one obvious thing that needs to change is societies dependence on constant immediate communication over phone calls, and I think we should demand that every service should be accessible over mail or text message in as good a service as over phone, be it doctors, banks, state institution, customer service etc. This is first something we make to stand up for ourselves, but it also directly benefits (even just somewhat) deaf and mute people, non native speakers, people with other forms of anxieties etc, so that the idea that that's good can definitely reach a majority, it just really takes time to fight for that to be codified into law, at least here in Germany there are often even really important things like medical services only accessible by phone, so it's obvious there is more work to be done on this.) The most difficult problem here is obviously employment, as that is tied to the structure of the economy, to capitalism and the state and ownership of land etc. I don't know if things are really changing here, how likely a UBI might be in ten, twenty years or so, but I'm not completely without hope; not so much because I think people want to change, but because, given how chaotic and under stress the world already is today, and what challenges lie ahead, they might have to.

It is what it is.  Even if you spend a bunch of time attributing things to Autism or something else, what does it solve?

If I don\'t do this I become overwhelmed and well, nothing gets done.  My home office is a perfect example of this.\n\nCleaning: This could be your energy being low or you\'re overwhelmed.  I\'ve experienced being overwhelmed by messy the house I share gets.  One way I\'ve tackled this (and it\'s not always great) is to each day pick one chore and get it done.  I work remote so if I have a break or a lunch I might take the trash out, run an errand, meal prep, etc.  Pick one thing a day and budget time for it.  Instead of waiting till the weekend or whatever and feeling like it\'s impossible.\n\nEnergy: The exhaustion at the end of the day for me is masking for all of the neurotypicals I work with and live with.  By the time I\'m done being fake (let\'s face it, we have to fit in their world if we want to thrive), I\'m ready to collapse mentally.  Taking frequent breaks helps, keeping hydrated, and being able to say no to interaction could help.\n\nOne area that doesn\'t get enough attention is supplementation.  Start looking at minerals and and supplements that could help.  For myself here\'s my list of stuff I take.\n\n- High-count probiotics/Digestive enzymes (many on the spectrum have gut issues the probiotics and enzymes can help)\n- B12/B6, many of us are deficient or can benefit from a boost in these.  The kidneys will waste what is not used.  \n- L-methylfolate (form of folic acid), has been found to be beneficial for behavior issues in Autistics\n- Omega 3/6: High concentration DHA can be good for the brain, plus Omegas are good for metabolic processes, weight control, and general cardiac health\n- Glutathione: Can be helpful with brain and gut inflammation, which many of us deal with\n- Calcium/Magnesium/Potassium/Sodium: Keeping electrolytes stable is important in everyone.  Many of us eat like shit or we get in these food-loops where we eat the same thing all the time and start to become malnourished.  \n\nOf course, I\'m not a doctor I just experiment on myself.  One thing I can say is diet really helps.  When I eat trash or processed foods the Autisms intensifies.  When I eat a clean diet (currently working towards 100% plant-based) my brain is in a better place.  Some Autistics will go paleo/keto.

I was pulled out of the gifted programmes and into special education which mainly aimed at fixing behaviour and not at academic achievements.\n\nI learned to resent my diagnosis as a result and instead of looking for help, I turned to substance abuse and overall acted as a rather toxic person for years. It wasn't until 2013 or so that I actually started to accept myself, 22 years after being diagnosed. And for actually looking for help, I didn't do that until the pandemic fucked everything up.\n\nAnd also, keep in mind that I spent my childhood in the Netherlands, one of the most developed countries on Earth in the 1990s.\n\nSo no, I'm sorry, but based on my own experiences, I likely would've done the same as your father did."", ""I fully understand.

We were split into groups, and I was a group of one. I was different than all the other managers and supervisors. I did an online test and I scored high enough to qualify as Asperger's.

I think many who discovered they were autistic later in life, myself included, will be able to relate and empathise. Got to admit, I was diagnosed with dyslexia when I was fairly young but that was never addressed and brushed under the rug as I could get on academically. Got to admit, the How to ADHD youtube channel made a really good point about dealing with ADHD struggles and trying to 'fit in' amongst a lot of internal, hidden struggles. I doubt most people can relate to this on the whole but I'm wondering if you might be able to.\n\nI think it goes without saying that the situation you've described about having this hidden from you is an awful thing to go through. My only thinking is with it is that it may have been hidden from you out of a genuine concern for you due to how disability can be perceived and would have been at the time. Sounds like your dad had a lot on his plate which could *explain* the situation but absolutely does not take away from the impact this will have had on you.\n\nI'm speaking from personal experience here but I think the most important thing to do now will be it continue living your life but with the new perspective you have gained. Hopefully you can look back on what has and hasn't worked for you and try to build your life around what works for you as an autistic person. No point trying to be a bad neurotypical anymore, you'll do a way better job of being a good autistic person.\n\nYou've mentioned living somewhere that doesn't really accommodate autistic adults. I wonder if you can get around this a bit by using language like 'I'm the sort of person who...' to avoid having to use the term but get some of your needs considered. In all honesty, diagnosing in a country that *should* support autism isn't exactly a great experience as an adult with the wider understanding that people actually have currently.\n\nAll the best and well done for posting this. You're not alone."", 'I am a late stage diagnosed as well, at age 54.  I had a similar life experience: memories of going to various therapies (speech, psychologists and others) and never flat out being told what was going on with me.

I am not at all trying to make this comment about me, only to give background knowledge to say thank you and convey how much I appreciate your sharing. I have always struggled with very volatile emotions. When I got angry, it was a full on rage or a complete shutdown. Throwing things and hitting myself or just going numb and showing nothing. The latter has typically accompanied more severe situations. My parents didn\'t know anything about mental health, but they never once tried to learn. My dad always told me ""you better control your anger or I\'ll do it for you"". Or my favorite when I would spaz out and hit myself ""come over here and let me do it"". He was ignorant. I unknowingly learned to mask by watching him. He was a very successful salesman due to his intelligence, quick wit, and charisma. I knew something was different in a (seemingly at the time) big way, but I felt like I was just stupid, weird, or both. I married an absolute genius of a nurse. She is a very active proponent of mental health. She figured it out first. Years ago. I received an official diagnosis about two weeks ago. At first I was very unsure of how to feel. I ignored the ""label"" out of fear that I would be shunned. As my wife said, I felt like I had a big red stamp on my forehead. I don\'t. I\'m just built differently. It wasn\'t until I read your post that it clicked for me. Thank you for empowering me to see myself for who I am. You are not broken. I am not broken. We are different.

You are doing so well & that makes me smile.  :)', 'I was diagnosed Asperger\'s in 2009 at age 26.\n\nBoth of my parents are very assertive types.  My dad\'s family leaned conservative, and he thought that seeking behavioral help wasn\'t necessary and that he would be able to train any bad behaviors out of me.  He largely did, and I bear the psychological scars associated with that.  I had expressed interest in learning about music recording and such, but he didn\'t want me to go into anything less than a high-paying engineering job.  He himself dropped out of college and was given a management position where he worked by my grandfather, who was the plant manager.  My dad was actually quite good at what he did, but is capable of being quite the asshole if he wants to be and I found that disagreeable.  I never wanted to be like that. \n\nMy mom had the best problem one could ask for:  much of her side of the family was mentally ill and in some cases quite badly, so she accepted me for who I was without question and never saw anything that she felt was in need of psychological intervention.  I hold no ill will against her at all, and sometimes wonder if more people were like her if those of us on the spectrum would have better lives.  She can occasionally be short-tempered, but it\'s not something that she likes about herself with and she tries to not let it slip.  I much prefer her approach.\n\nThere were two ""missed opportunities"" in my life.  My parents divorced before I started the 4th grade, and I was referred to a guidance counselor at my school  Mrs. Cotton was a wonderful woman.  I\'ll touch on why I don\'t believe she did anything wrong when I get to my diagnosis.\n\nThe other missed opportunity is a story that starts out tragically and then falls into a black hole.  I attempted suicide at age 18 (20 years ago).  I survived, obviously, and was referred to a psychologist.  I saw Dr. Cometa every week or every other week for two years.  I attended college at this time, but ultimately dropped out due to not having any sense of direction (and the reasons become apparent at the end of this) and took a job at my stepdad\'s office as a secretary.  While I didn\'t like my circumstances, I didn\'t feel depressed so I ended our appointments.  During this time my dad married a stripper.\n\nA month later my mom calls me.  I love her to death and understand the news was shocking to her, she hadn\'t been seeing the man for 2 years and her delivery hit like a meteor.  Dr. Cometa had been arrested on charges of production and distribution of child pornography.  Pretty much the entire time I\'d been seeing him if not longer, he had been preying upon teenage girls in a back room in his office.  I was completely oblivious.  He was convicted and prior to his sentencing hearing he and his wife (who I believe was a patient he had groomed) drove down to the beach and shot themselves.\n\nI worked as a secretary awhile, and then my dad got me a manufacturing job doing assembly line work...which incidentally is where he started at the company before being promoted up:  some ""natural"" promotion, some ""assisted"" promotion.  I was well liked by supervisors and coworkers alike, but ultimately the company decided to close down the factory and move to Texas, where they could pay lower wages at a non-union plant (our plant was unionized before the company bought it).  The company probably lost more money moving operations than it recouped on wages not paid, but sticking it to the union was important.  My dad probably would have done for me what my grandfather did for him, but really that was just doomed and I don\'t hold that against him at all.\n\nConcurrent with this, my dad had been diagnosed with cancer and his treatment became pretty heavy in 2009 (He is still alive today and his cancer is in remission, but it\'s an odd medical thing where it could just come back for genetic reasons).  I had become depressed to the point of needing to see a psychologist because I was worried I might harm myself again.  I met my second psychologist the day I turned 26.  He was quite old (68...he\'s 80 today and as spry, witty and hopelessly Republican as ever), and after relaying thing to him for 15 minutes he told me I had Asperger\'s.  He said it thinking that I would have had some familiarity with it:  nobody had ever suggested to me in my life that I was on the spectrum.  I cried for 5 minutes straight before regaining my composure.  12 years on I still consider it the most important day of my life.\n\nAt that initial appointment, my current psychologist said that I was ""well-compensated"".  This is why I said I didn\'t feel my guidance counselor in elementary school didn\'t do anything wrong:  it was the 90\'s, and me kind of flying under the radar was something that would have been far more common back then because I wasn\'t considered a ""behavior problem"" and in fact was quite shy and reserved.\n\nSince then, my dad is now divorced from the stripper, I tried to get into IT and never really took off.  2 years ago I decided to try going back to college to get a 2-year degree in music technology and audio engineering.  I felt I was decently competent at a few things in that field.  I discovered quickly that I have a certain ""edge"" in the field and am not only quite capable with the general ""signal"" related subjects, but my computer skills that weren\'t ""good enough"" in the IT world make me damn near a messianic figure in the recording industry because a lot of the stuff I was weak in isn\'t ""weakness that can get somebody killed"" in that field.  \n\nThe great tragedy here is that when I was a teenager, I was forming interest in audio engineering but was told that it should be kept a ""hobby"" and only be pursued if I succeeded in a ""high-paying job"" like Electrical Engineer first.  While I\'ve learned a lot over the past 20 years, my mind isn\'t dramatically different from what it was 20 years ago and perhaps the course of my life could have been dramatically improved had I been encouraged.', 'I remember being probably 2.5-3.5 years old in a doctors waiting room watching cartoons on the TV. My mom took me into a room where a nice female doctor and I played a bunch games with rules and turn taking and then played with some blocks. Never really thought much about it until a few years ago when I read part of the autism evaluation for that age is turn-based play, sharing, and block stacking/repetitive behaviors.\n\nI want to ask my mom what the result of that day was but at the same time, I don‚Äôt see much purpose in stirring that pot. Either I was given a clean bill of mental health (which for a toddler girl in the 90s, what‚Äôs the really worth?), or my mom was told I was most likely autistic and it was never spoken of again. Asperger‚Äôs or high functioning autism is pretty spot on when I evaluate myself.\n\nNow I‚Äôm an adult and a voluntold supervisor and goddamn it I would love some kind of play by play manual of how to interact with my staff.

Identifying ourselves as loners takes away society\'s\' responsibility for us taking the *LONER* label upon ourselves, when the term should actually be ***OUTCASTS***.

I switched psychiatrists a year later simply because the psychiatrist that I had wasn‚Äôt working well with me (she was telehealth and didn‚Äôt explain anything; you could tell she was just in it for the money. Ironically, her website says she has experience working with autistic people). The new psychiatrist (who is my current psychiatrist and I was one of her first patients outside of her training) saw my autistic traits and referred me to an adult autism specialist (neuropsychologist) because she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable enough to diagnose. The neuropsychologist told me that there‚Äôs no doubt that I was autistic and that my first psychiatrist was grossly wrong for diagnosing me with BPD.', 'I figured I kinda lacked the ability to make sense out of the world like normsl people do.

I was only diagnosed 4 years ago at the advanced age of 54. Psychology and neurology are two of my dearest special interests, and about 10 years back, I came across something called non language-related learning disorder, referring to an unusual facility with language counterbalanced by deficits in visual/spatial and mathematical domains. At the time, the condition was considered a close cousin to the ASDs, and it described me perfectly. I sought and received testing, and a diagnosis.\n\nFor some years following, I was in denial that I might have Asperger's, a possibility that had been raised by several relative strangers. Each time it came up, I was deeply hurt. Additionally, the isolation, depression, and higher suicide rates associated with Asperger's were more than discouraging,  suggesting that achieving an approximation of contentment, something that has persistently eluded me, was not possible.\n\nI'm female, had had addiction problems from adolescence until 2012, and a history of turbulent attempted relationships ending in rejection, something I handled in a rather self destructive manner. This earned me a diagnosis of borderline personality since college until 2018, when I decided to pursue testing for autism and ADD. I'm inattentive as hell unless absolutely captivated by the subject at hand, and none of the therapy I'd gotten for BPD had helped much, if at all. I figured that at the least, I might be able to access more effective treatment if what ailed me was better defined.\n\nLong story shorter, I sat with the  diagnostician for 6 hours, took tests, questioned my old ma about my early childhood, and later emerged with a newly minted ASD/ADD-inattentive type label. Can't say I had any emotion about that; it was actually anticlimactic. But I jumped onto the boards and forums, and finally, finally found a sense of community that had been missing since my punk rock days. Some of my fellow autists amaze me, others break my heart, and several have been absolute assholes--but that's okay. I'm prescribed Intuniv for the rejection sensitivity disorder, and it takes the edge off most of the time.\n\nNot sure how to tie this up.

I understand that you feel lonely and it‚Äôs difficult for you, but your presence won‚Äôt help him recover faster. \n\nSomething I would recommend is to make appointments for your time together. I know it doesn‚Äôt sound romantic, but if it were me I would be better able to handle spending time with someone if I knew very well beforehand when and where we would socialize and what we would do (e.g. eat at this restaurant, watch this movie at this theater at this time, go for a walk on this path). It also helps to have a general idea of when the social interaction ends. For example, every Tuesday night you go out to eat in a restaurant at 7pm for roughly 2-3 hours. Every Friday night you go see a movie around 8pm. Obviously there can be some deviation there, but idea is that he should know what to expect. Autistic people thrive on routine. \n\nDon‚Äôt expect him to of his own accord call/text and ask you out. He won‚Äôt. He will do his own thing. If you ask and he is not tired he will go. But if he is tired/not prepared then he won‚Äôt. By scheduling interactions, it helps him be prepared to spend time with you mentally, so that he can better manage his energy throughout the day. Obviously I don‚Äôt know your boyfriend and he might not like this idea, but I think I would really like it. So maybe bring it up.

When I was sometimes just suddenly recharged, I would compensate for lost together-time by actively seeking her out and making her laugh and feel loved, surprise her with romantic candlelit dinners after work and give her some extra good coitus.

He put liquid THC in your coffee, OR in his own coffee that you accidentally drank. The reason I say this is because liquid THC absorbs into your bloodstream fairly quickly, which would have caused you to feel its effects soon after ingesting the coffee.

He could have done this purposefully, or maybe he was using it to aid his hangover symptoms and you grabbed the wrong cup/he didn't know you would drink the coffee. \n\n3.

517,"I dont feel at home in this world anymore. Looking for others who love stories, music and video games. (Long post but it seems the only kind i can make, I hope youll take the time to read and consider)","['games', 'read']",wjp0vk,10,"[""Hey just saying hello. I am recently divorced as well. We are similar in some ways. I also am almost overly observant socially. It is hit or miss. I see some things that other people miss, but I also miss things that other people see. Overall though I feel like I see a lot socially, usually I see more than NTs, I just can't act out anything appropriate in return. It is a one way street where my brain understands most social things but can't perform them correctly. I'd be good as a detective or poker player or something where I only need to read people, but not do anything socially myself.\n\nMusic is a huge part of my life too and the one thing that reliably lifts my mood and makes me feel happy. More than happy, it is meaningful, important, awe-inspiring, life-affirming, etc.\n\nMy relationship with friends is.. I've kinda given up on the idea. I want friends I guess, but I might as well want wings or horns on my head. I want them but I recognize I would literally have to be an entirely different person than I am to have them. I try to form shallow acquaintances and I get some social stimulation from that. If they try to advance things into actual friendship it freaks me out and I back away. Overall I find socializing usually unpleasant, but necessary for mental health. And very rarely, with the right people in the exact right circumstance and just for a moment, it is enjoyable, and these rare moments which are probably not even memorable for the other people present just glow in my mind and memory as nearly the most meaningful experiences of my life. That brief instant of connection actually happening.\n\nThere is no one way to have Aspergers, the deal with it is that certain regions of the brain are more connected than NTs, and other regions are less connected than NTs, but which exact regions are more or less, is different for everybody. Since you like video games, it is like mother nature picked each of our talent trees or stats while absolutely hammered. Some of us have points in areas that others do not, so I think it is normal to feel a little bit alone and unique even among aspies because we are all different. Way too many points in one area and no points in another.\n\nI am also a lapsed poet who started writing a little bit again after my divorce. I have always loved poetry, but it's kinda like the social thing. I am a better consumer of it than producer.\n\nI relate to what you are saying about loving life, seeing beauty in the world, and at the same time feeling constantly estranged.\n\nUnfortunately that is where the similarity ends, I don't really game or have much interest in fiction at all. Interests are so tricky because they are so personal and rigid, at least for me, I find it nearly impossible to muster an ounce of care for somebody else's interests.\n\nI enjoyed reading your post. Try to get yourself out there and at least get some small talk in with real people. Total isolation is not good for anybody."", ""Hi! I'd like to apologise first, because I read through some, but not all of your post, so I might have missed out on some things. This is because I actually have things to do, I'm just procrastinating on them.\n\nI wasn't divorced, but after a breakup, I was incredibly lonely and at a certain point in time it was unbearable, especially since all I could remember was the good times. I haven't watched Love on teh Spectrum, because I don't subscribe to any service ($$). But I knew that I had Asperger's since I was 19, and I had it confirmed by a professional. When I knew about it, it felt almost relieving to know why I've always felt so different. So, since you feel that way, I won't be surprised if you're indeed on the spectrum after all.\n\nAlso, I'm interested in writing stories (though I'm only writing fanfiction at the moment), music and video games. \n\nHowever, I don't think we're interested in the same music genres. I'm mostly into industrial metal and rock music, as well as postrock. My favourite band is Tool. I'm a bit fuzzy about genres, but most of the bands I like seem to fall within these genres, so I'll just go with that. I don't listen to music as much as I'd like to these days, because I have no time for it. \n\nI'm not sure how we would talk about writing, either, because I'm currently only writing fanfiction at the moment, and it's heavily romance focused. I do have trouble trying to create good plot. At the present moment, how I go about plot is that I basically either ask my readers to give me some requests, or I just wing it based on what I feel like writing at the moment... Which means that plot-wise, it's not very good. \n\nAs for video games, I haven't really had much time to play it either. But my favourite video game is definitely Skyrim, followed by Morrowind. I just love exploring a foreign landscape with details baked in. Though I'm not a fan of Elder Scrolls Online. I don't actually have that many video games in my Steam account, once I find a game I like, I sink hundreds and hundreds of hours into it. I also like the Dragon Age series for its story and romance.\n\nAnyway, if you want to talk regardless of our differences, I'm always open to talking. You're right - it's really easy to disappear online, especially because of the time difference and RL commitments. But it's probably worth a try. I have a habit of disappearing and reappearing whenever, because usually there are things taking up my attention span and I sometimes forget to reply. It's way easier to get to know people in person, but it's harder to find people that I could be friends with IRL, even though there are many friendly people in general."", ""I just recently got diagnosed, so I figured I'd start getting more involved with the community and this seemed a good place to start.\n\nI am also divorced, 30, and feel a lot of the things you do. I am not religous, but I do love art and beauty and learning how to enjoy existence from within my own framework for experiencing it.\n\nI love to write and - although I've been in a dry spell lately - I have written a novel (wasn't great honestly, but I it ws finished at least!) and it was sci fi. I typically hang out in sci fi, horror or magical realism for writing (and for movies and games, typically). Haruki Murakami and Philip K. Dick are some of my favorite authors.\n\nI go back and forth on whether or not I'm in the mood for music, but when I do, it is often electronic. My 'comfort' artist is Com Truise. Very synthy kind of stuff. Synthwave, I think it is?\n\nI also love videogames and play a lot. Potentially too much? Eh, I can't be bothered to care lately.\n\nI, like many of us here, just sorta feel alien. I am learning to love it more than hate it, but it is a bit of a tug-of-war between those extremes. I don't know how to make friends, because I know that my unmasked self is not the most appealing to others. I like the idea of finding people with whom I can unmask, but also know that it's going to be a difficult and potetntially fruitless search. \n\nLet me know if you wanna try and chat.

However, as far as I understand, it is not an issue in a particular part of a brain, but something different in the whole neural system or at least widely around inside there.\n\nYou can grow out of some of the problems autism causes. You can have other mental issues. They can be connected in some very distinct way - but can they be disconnected? Like... it is relatively easy to say that this person is an alcoholic. He has had that propensity since his birth and it became actual when he noticed that alcohol relieves his stress for a moment and he got addicted very, very quickly. But is it really possible to insist that he is an alcoholic and has Asperger's but these two are not connected anyhow?\n\nIn my life there has been one particular period when I was ecxeptionally good at something. I really wanted to get to university but had failed in high school/gymnasium (how to translate that?) twice. When I made my third attempt it looked like I was about to fail again. Finally I ended up studying at home and doing only the tests at school. When I was not forced to go to school early in the morning and stay there for six to eight hours, the whole process took about a half of the usual duration. And the results were good, average 9,1/10 on this local scale. Moreover, I ran a rock band and composed music for that with my brother. And I finally found a girl friend. This all was possible because I did not have to waste my time on something totally unnecessary, like sitting in classes doing noting, or stress about too many things. The stress itself is a huge energy drain.\n\nI am trying to say that autists are not Jacks of all trades. But when someone finds her/his trade, results can be remarkable. Being on the most suitable branch is vital for autists because something else does not satisfy. So, I postulate that finding a suitable occupation and job is more than necessary. Otherwise life turns to surviving and seeking relief. And that causes stress and depression! This is not a solution to all the autistic problems. But still it is necessary!"", 'Hi, OP.\n\nFunny enough, I fit into your description to a ""T"", including my past worries whether I may be ASPD or NPD.\n\nI always knew that I was different and also thought that autism didn\'t fit till I heard one autistic tour guide on Heygo talking about it on Autism Awareness Week.

Distancing, feeling something\'s wrong, not belonging anywhere, feeling misunderstood, unappreciated, alien, doing my best not to stand out, or to be accepted or liked, getting defensive when I feel threatened. Feeling like no matter what I do or say, someone will be hurt by it and I\'ll be left clueless and miserable, feeling like a monster. Narcissism is a defense mechanism triggered by childhood trauma like being abandoned, mistreated, abused, etc.\n\nAND, of course, it can be a mix of this and that. That\'s why it\'s called a ""Spectrum"", no two people are exactly alike. Narcissism is also a spectrum and it overlaps with other mind-fucks like BPD (Borderline, which also has the people-pleasing as a main trait).\n\nFrom what you say it does seem like you want to please people so you get accepted. Please look into Borderline and Narcissism (more likely Vulnerable / Covert). And also please don\'t self-diagnose and don\'t accept any ""finding"" as a sentence or a curse. Don\'t stop looking and reading, and eventually you will figure out the pieces that lead to the bigger picture, then you will be able to track back everything you ever did, said and felt and make sense of it, and then be able to predict your future actions, feelings and thoughts and take measures to limit the triggers. You will need to admit some harsh truths and see yourself from a perspective different than your own. ""The road to hell is covered with good intentions.""

It causes me a lot of stress when I find out there are rules I was previously unaware of and annoys me when others disregard rules until it suits them."", 'I have a similar experience, particularly in childhood, however I also have a devious side that strives to protect my autonomy if I feel a rule is unfair, or violates my innate code of ethics. \n\nI typically follow rules very strictly by default. Any time I\'ve ever felt I was going to be ""in trouble"" with an authority figure, I\'ve panicked and usually broken down crying. Which is embarrassing after the age of about 8 lol.\n\nIn my adolescence I became friends with a troublesome crowd. They accepted me despite my weirdness. This led to me being covertly rebellious; getting high after school, breaking into off-limits parts of my high school, etc. I still followed every rule when in the presence of authority figures. Eventually, I took to avoiding authority figures whenever possible.\n\nUnfortunately, I also have pure OCD that manifests as religious intrusive thoughts. I consider how ""God"", or some abstract ultimate authority, might judge my actions. I believe this is due to me being raised Christian, and also the innate rule-following quality I possess. It\'s been difficult to shake this off, and express myself as I truly feel. I feel that my fear of being judged, my fear of authority, and my rule-following tendencies have become pathological and I struggle to simply let myself be. I believe that I have internalized the bullying, by peers and authority figures, judgment, etc, I received as a child and now wear a permanent mask.

I was always a really ‚Äúgood‚Äù kid only because the idea of breaking a rule cause so much anxiety that I‚Äôd avoid it at all cost. I‚Äôm an adult now and I still do this, but now I do it for a lot of social rules also. Like ‚Äúam I allowed to paint my living room this bright color‚Äù or ‚Äúam I allowed to wear this outfit to this place.‚Äù They‚Äôre not written rules or intuitive to me, but I‚Äôve memorized them to mask.\n\nI think it was my way of trying to fit in, it gave me structure on how to navigate the world. Rules are the only written guidance you get so even if I can‚Äôt follow social cues, I can at least be ‚Äúgood‚Äù in some way. There are times when I really hate this, I‚Äôve missed out on a lot of things because fun stuff is always against the rules. And sometimes the rules betray me, are contradictory, or immoral.', ""One thing I've noticed with a lot of autistic people is not only rigid rule-following, but also taking absolutely everything that anyone says as 100% true and a 100% authoritative rule that has to be followed at all times. This then leads to a lot of problems when it turns out the person who said the thing didn't mean the more rigid interpretation, or didn't mean for it to apply more than once, or never had the authority to tell people to do that thing in the first place.\n\nA better approach is to question every rule or anything that sounds like a rule. Ask yourself whether the person issuing it actually has any kind of authority whatsoever, or whether the rule meaningfully applies in the way you think it might, or whether the rule itself is just goddamn stupid and should be actively fought against."", ""I was a lot like that as a kid. I grew up in a pretty abusive household, so I would just tie myself in knots in fear of getting in trouble. We also attended a fire and brimstone church, which gave me this sort of existential fear of a similar type. (Religion got even more difficult when I learned there were different approaches toward religion and they often contradicted one another.)\n\nThis is an important growth point on a couple of fronts. One of them is learning how to gauge when breaking or bending a rule is okay and learning to deal with the anxiety that comes with that, which can be hard. For better or worse, rules are based on ideals. Learning how and when it's fine to break rules, or otherwise what rules are tolerable to break, is an art and it can be hard to get down. \n\nPart of that too is also learning to figure out what you can get away with and what you can't. It can be hard gauging what and when people are paying attention. It took me a long time because I was the youngest kid in the family, so I didn't just have parents, but I had snitchy siblings who were always watching. It took many years to realize when people weren't paying so much attention.\n\nAnother is building your own motivation. It's a common tripping point in early adulthood that people who grow up in pretty rigid environments, either externally or internally imposed, run into issues with managing motivation. This is especially tricky when executive function issues come into play. I struggled for a lot of my early adulthood, partially because a lot of what I did or didn't do really didn't have an apparent effect. (It ultimately had large effects. Skipping classes, not doing assignments, or not doing various life maintenance activities often came out in the wash with expensive effects later down the road.) My spouse teaches college and it's a pretty common thing, especially among younger students who are on their own their first time.\n\nA part of going into adulthood in a pretty healthy way is learning discipline, which is basically setting your own rules for yourself and learning to follow them consistently. Some of this may be setting goals for yourself and building a path toward that, but in some way learning to build the structure that used to be put there by parents, teachers, and other authority figures. It's not easy, but when you have nobody else to tell you what to do, and that's your only motivation, it can be easy to feel pretty rudderless, which can have bad mental effects.\n\nI don't know, I hope some of that might help, or otherwise will help you feel a little less alone or something. Personally, I hate rules, but live pretty tightly by them because I found around age 25 that I really do better in a structured situation. I eventually turned my weirdness with rules into a profession by accident, because I worked at a company that wasn't good at explaining what the rules were."", 'I have always been a rule-follower.  As far as I know, I didn\'t have any actual trauma, but if my parents even *looked* at me wrong as a kid, I would break down crying out of guilt.  I was probably 7 or 8 before I realized I could get out of bed and grab a book after lights were out.  Even that was the limit of my ""rebellion.""  (Much in contrast to my older brother, who tested every rule thoroughly.) \n\nWe were always supervised, and there was no lack of rules in my  house growing up.  It gave me a strong framework for social interactions, but also a lot of confusion when other people did not follow the rules and weren\'t punished.  It wasn\'t until I became an adult that I began untangling it all.  Here\'s a system I worked out that might help you relax a little bit.  It has certainly helped me:  \n\nThere are three types of rules:\n\n* **Red Rules** \\- Crucial social framework.  Break them and you may end up in prison, as they can involve irreparably harming others.  Almost always apply.  *Don\'t kill, don\'t drive drunk, don\'t set the building on fire.*\n* **Yellow Rules** \\- Can be broken, but at a cost.  The cost is generally temporary and either physical or social.  *Don\'t talk back to your boss, get eight hours of sleep, don\'t gossip.*\n* **Green Rules** \\- Fake rules!  Following them will help you blend in to society, but breaking them holds no significant consequences.  *Don\'t dance at random, wear matching clothes, paint your home in neutral colors.*', 'My internal rules made it really hard to live with my parents, finally just moved out today.', ""I used to be like that but not as much now.

I wrote everything else before I wrote this, so this mostly pertains to school rules but keep in mind I\'m a socially isolated person who only just graduated high school this June. \n\nI used to obsessively follow rules and then gradually over time I learned a lot of rules were bullshit and made by people in power who just want to enforce their power, not for safety reasons or common sense reasons. I also got extremely pissed off when people in power just come up with their own rules that contradict written rules. For example, I had a band director who was usually an amazing teacher until the end of my senior year when they decided to force everyone in all of their classes to take the final exam. This was against school policy because ANY junior or senior who had a 90+ overall average and a 90+ average in the 4th marking period was exempt. Their excuse was ""I made the class easy."" I don\'t care. Follow what\'s written. Your rules don\'t supercede the school rules.\n\nI\'ve advocated on behalf of my peers for rules that everybody thought were stupid. Sometimes it worked. Other times it didn\'t. For example, my senior year (wow this is a trend) my schools administration decided this year if you had an AP exam you had to come in the full day, despite the policy being every other year you left or came in late after your exam. Apparently exams for college credit don\'t mean shit. I ended up no joke writing up a petition and about a 1/5 of my class signed it. That got repealed. What didn\'t get repealed is the uniform policy. The administration would tell the teachers to stop teaching to focus on the uniform policy. This pisses me off because 95% of the time it\'s because students wear hoodies in cold weather getting in trouble. A lot of these students are wearing school spirit hoodies, so I tried meeting them half way and trying to make spritwear allowed, and every teacher I talked to agreed. I was supposed to be on the uniform committee my sophomore year but then corona happened, I was supposed to then be on it my senior year but they strangely never met. Or they met and I wasn\'t allowed to. My relationship with the school administration got really tarnished my last month of school because I smoked pot on my own time (it\'s legal where I live now, and the rules are written poorly to the point it\'s legal for anyone to smoke). Randomly drug tested for sports and clubs, and I just barely hit the threshold. \n\nI\'ve always also tried to find loopholes. There were so many in my high school that the administration was pissed at me whenever I pointed them out. I pointed out how collective punishment was against the 4th Genova Convention. Still being used to this day. I\'ve read the entire school handbook. I\'ve found contradictions. I\'ve also read the district policy. A lot of that, mostly regarding teachers, isn\'t enforced. It\'s also outdated and they haven\'t repealed it. You are not allowed to bring a pager to school or sports games. Yes that\'s a real rule.\n\nDespite this, I\'ve never gotten suspended or detention except lunch detention. Some of its maybe because my mom was on the board of education and teachers were afraid. I think though that the few rules I\'ve broken were so miniscule I\'ve only ever gotten warnings. The exception is I\'ve gotten suspended from sports and clubs for a while my last month of school, but by then the golf season and robotics season was over, and we had a lot of people in chess club better than me that the teacher who ran it was more upset I couldn\'t make it then she was at me smoking weed.\n\nHowever, PS, when I was younger I was a real shit head online.

As far as I understand it, autism is a result of your brain developing differently than usual but it‚Äôs therefore not wrong. We just see things differently and value other things than other people and that can make you feel out of place among other people.\n\nI am not a psychologist or anything so I don‚Äôt know if this is good advice, but for me it helps to try and observe what other people like and value. Knowing these things might help you have more meaningful conversations with them that keep them interested as well. \nIt‚Äôs also important to stay true to yourself however, you don‚Äôt have to change yourself into a person they would like to hang out with. My psychologist told me that a lot of girls with autism mimic other girls around them to fit in, but it only makes them depressed in the long run because they live like someone they‚Äôre not.\n\nTLDR: try to find people that have similar interests and see if you enjoy hanging out with them. And there‚Äôs no shame in consulting professional help if you find it difficult. They have made it their job to try and help people for a reason', 'One common aspie trait is not naturally breaking large undertakings into smaller tasks. As a result things can feel unachievable and overwhelming. Speaking of dads I am always inspired by my own dad in this regard, because he is not intimidated by any project and will just work at things slowly and steadily and patiently, one little piece at a time, until he gets things done. Anyway here is my advice: you need to define goals that are more specific and smaller. ""Fix your brain"" is way too broad and vague. Try to narrow down exactly what parts of your life you want to work on. Once you figure that out, set a small specific achievable goal that is the first step toward what you want. And then just keep working towards your big goal, one little step at a time. The objective I hear from your writing is that you want to be normal and be accepted by NTs.. I am sorry but that is probably not going to happen. I would try to define a more achievable goal, like finding a small niche community of people who do accept you, or learning to participate in the world and not care what NTs think, or mask successfully enough to get some surface level relationships with NTs while understanding that is probably all they will ever be. Idk I\'m still struggling with all this myself. But what I mean is, set a realistic goal (curing autism is not realistic) and then take small steps toward it.\n\nand, no offense intended at all but I think you should try to let your past go a little bit. We all tell stories about ourselves and try to make our lives fit a narrative, but at a certain point it does not pay to always look to the past and try to assign causes to things. The past seems to weigh really heavily on you. Sometimes it is better to just see the present clearly, accept how things are, and let the past be past, and try to figure out how we can move into the future.

So I'm used to people not liking my music, it kinda comes with the metal culture. But finding someone whose a fellow metalhead is the best, then we get to share our interest and bond with them a bit. Plus once you've been yelled at by extremist christians while waiting in line for a concert, that you'll be going to hell for this music. Nothing really bothers you about sharing this type of music anymore. I get proud for my interest instead and happily represent the metal community to people who've never listened before, when they ask. \n\nThe only times it got embarrassing is when I played that kind of music during social situations not fully appropriate/in the mood for that kind of sound.

Everytime I get someone else interested in my music, I get really excited that someone else is hearing and enjoying these songs I love. \n\nAlso I play drums casually, so you kinda have to be ok with people hearing you make music. Since I can't turn down my drums volume lol. And don't have a dedicated sound proof room/bunker to practice in. So it's either remain embarrassed or push through it for the sake of playing my instrument.\n\nBeyond all that, the easy solution is just don't give a fuck what others think if it's negative. Music is personal, there is no such thing as listening to the wrong band/artist. If they judge negatively for listening to something they don't like, that's their problem not yours. A normal adult will never judge you personally for the music you enjoy. Either they will like it and be happy you shared yourself with them, or they'll dislike the music but still appreciate you sharing yourself with them. Be proud of what makes you, you. That's how you bond with others who are like minded or share interests. It feels so much better than hiding everything away. \n\nAlso above all, music isn't that important to be this concerned about others' reactions. Not unless you're like 14. As an adult nobody gives a shit really. It's just music, everyone listens to something and it won't be universally liked. It shouldn't really or it would be incredibly boring. Judging someone on their music tastes is like judging them on their favorite color. There is no wrong answer, so it doesn't matter.

It was embarrassing because it did not feel very manly, but pilates helped a lot. It is a lot of isolation exercises which focus on balance and control. I am not sure how much it would help with grappling in particular, but I did find an increase in body awareness when I was doing 15-30 min routine everyday.', 'Hiya,i used to be a pro/semipro mma athlethe until my injury. I had the very same problem of clumsiness. For me,the answer was stylistic. I focused heavily on training my bjj in very single directional techniques in offense (think like john danahers teachings of rolling armbar or the way khabib mounts, tanking positions with pressure and grinding) and defense in constant active movement. For striking, muay thai has very good close in forms like muay mat punching to compensate agility. I am 1,88m tall, so you would expect me to fight at range. However,i trained very hard to clinch, takedown, transistional wrestle and ground game.\n\nWhen it comes to agility, i suggest based on my experience:\n-When shadow boxing, imagine a hopscotch area, bounce around the ""boxes"" while constantly attacking in different heights.\n-use swimming tubes(the soft things? XD) with partner to train both movement with dodges (line drill) and takedowns (swing and shoot)\n-Train high kicks with partner taking turns like ""kata"", so one defends on one side and other replies instantly. Repeat while walking set distance, then switch.\n-training acrobatic moves in cooldown or warmup can help, imagine modern dancing as a form \n\nAs for fight gameplans, i highly suggest prioritizing grounded, linear forms to support clearer techniques so you dont get confused. First fights get always swamped in exitement so no worries if you cant get them 100% as planned\n\nHope this helps,ask if i can assist more :D', 'Training. Lots and lots of training.

Also one of the ways I dealt with my deficits in speed was to close the distance. I knew once I closed, all it took was getting a hand lock. The second I got that I would go right into taking balance and then drive to the ground. Even better when you can use them as the landing pad. \n\nI worked a lot on grappling and working grips and handholds.

I know your intentions were good but you have to learn how to read signals of when a person (especially a female) wants to be engaged. It can be in public, the gym, grocery store, waiting in line, etc. But it has to be organic and not forced. Never interrupt them while they are busy minding their own business and when they are in a vulnerable environment / time of day (night time).\n\nYou have to learn how to ""read the room"", feel the energy vibes and look for engagement signals / hints. If they are staring at you and smiling or say hi and keep  looking at you, or are constantly in your space, adjusting their hair, fixing their clothes, fixing themselves in the mirror, then these are queues that they (might) want to be engaged by you. My rule of thumb is to never randomly cold approach people with unsolicited, forced interactions / conversations unless they initiate first or give strong aforementioned signals that they want to be engaged by me.

The fact that the conversation was forced and going nowhere made it all the more suspicious.

Looking to the past, one could see that a revolutionary change could be building. However history never had to face an existential consequence to a revolutionary change. This leads to an uncertain outcome, which in turn, increases fear and social polarization. I see the present way that society is organized and operates as unsustainable. The concentrations of wealth and power work to sustain themselves. It seems like it will take a significant trigger to trip a revolutionary change. Hopefully a portion of humanity will be sufficiently resilient to create something sustainable.', 'Resources are becoming more scarce. Humans become more aggressive/competitive when this happens.

Mostly those identities are expressed in material possessions - you can upgrade your identity by upgrading your house, car or wardrobe etc. Since the turn of the century, ""values"" (ie. feelings) has become another way to identify yourself among the poorer end of society who can\'t afford the premium material goods. It\'s isolating because it puts the individual in competition against the rest of society. Since the rise of smart phones people have become more isolated. Some young people (who are not autistic) will not pick up the phone and call people - including employers - because they don\'t have the skills to speak to people properly.

I couldn‚Äôt understand how people chose the objects in their homes. Why that lamp? Why that picture? How do you choose a style?

It‚Äôs okay. You don‚Äôt have to be original. Start with your home for example. Do you feel safer being surrounded by lots of warmly colored things or do you prefer a cold minimalism?\n\nI went to go buy furniture to start my new life. Instinctively I went to a used furniture store. So I guess I prefer older things with real wood. New furniture seemed too artificial or commercial somehow. After looking at their selection, I found that out of their selection I liked Danish furniture. I had never seen or heard of it before. I just stumbled into it. So I bought Danish furniture that all went together. Someone else had invented that style, but I thought it was good enough.

When people have a crush, they often just have a lot of fantasies about that person while barely knowing them, so they just like the fantasies they have about them. This is usually based on looks, since people often get a crush on someone because they find them attractive, which is just lust. So unless you know that person well you can\'t say if you actually like them or not.\n\nAnd desperation and loneliness definitely causes people to get a crush on someone much more easily. All it often takes is for a girl to just be nice one time when interacting with a guy who is lonely and he will get a crush on her. And people with aspergers tend to be quite lonely, so it makes sense that this is more common for them. I can speak from experience, in high school when I was very lonely I easily got a crush on a girl I barely knew, but nowadays I don\'t feel lonely and pretty much don\'t get a crush on anyone, when it happens it\'s rare.\n\nAnd for me it always takes time before I like someone, like I have to know and interact with her for a few months before I start to really like her. I\'m not sure how common this is though, it might just be me lol.

So it is not some rare and special occurrence, I think maybe just everybody‚Äôs brain has a broad category of people they could possibly be attracted to, and then random chance makes the brain decide it has a crush on one or two people in particular. If those people were to suddenly vanish, it seems like the brain would latch by chance on to someone else.\n\nFor me, and I am guessing maybe other very isolated people, the pool of people to interact with is very small. I generally like most people, but they are tiring and hard for me to interact with. If I like someone so much I would seek them out to interact with regularly, it maybe makes sense that brain would also latch onto them as a crush. So maybe I am both lonely and have a crush at same time. It just seems more random than a regular person, because my pool of relationships is much smaller.', 'It‚Äôs relatable!

585,Relationship advice needed ‚Ä¶ kind of long,"['relationship', 'long']",wie997,6,"['In philosophy there is a thought experiment called the prisoners dilemma. I will probably explain it wrong but anyway here is how I understand it: 2 prisoners could choose to betray each other or work together. The most logical thing to do is betray, but if they do this it results in the worst outcome for both prisoners. The only way to achieve a good outcome is that one prisoner must act illogically and ""extend the olive branch"" of cooperation. A blind and unwise leap of faith for that prisoner, putting oneself in a vulnerable position and unsure if the other one will reciprocate or not. But without the leap of faith, the default logical path of betrayal leads to ""mutually assured destruction"" for both. One person has to take the chance.\n\nI thought about this often during my marriage. When a distance starts to grow and you feel a big divide growing and growing between you and your partner: It doesn\'t matter who is right or wrong. Both people are hurting. Neither person is getting what they need from the relationship. I don\'t feel like I want to say ""sorry"" or be the one to try to patch things up because I feel like it is her fault. And I myself am hurting too. But... Prisoners dilemma.. one person must extend the olive branch and make a move towards peace. So, many times I would make some small move towards her, whatever I could muster, and that would make all the difference in the world. Even just like making her a cup of coffee in the morning. Just something to show I care and I want things to work and I am trying.\n\nIn your case, maybe think about what your partners needs are that aren\'t being met and make a small gesture to show that you care. I know it is hard when you yourself are also hurting, but that is what has to be done. If he is helping with the cost of the apartment and got defensive about the issues with noise etc, he prob feels inadequate and insecure about it. I felt the same way when my wife would raise a complaint about the house, it was like damn, I am doing my best here and trying to provide us a good place. She didn\'t mean it that way, but that was always how I took it. As men we are expected to provide and these days it can be hard to feel like are providing enough.\n\nSo that is my advice if you want to make things work. One person has to take a step back towards the other, try to close the gap of distance, and offer some vulnerability and sensitivity and try to meet the others needs. It is hard to do and feels unnatural but it must be done to reverse the drift apart and come back together.', 'So to start with just a little bit of tough love (to get it out of the way) if you can work on developing your life skills so you‚Äôre more independent you‚Äôd be in a better spot. Getting groceries, paying bills, calling neighbors/landlords over complaints, these are all intimidating but can be learned. You should try to work on this so you‚Äôre not as reliant on a partner doing this for you. The person kicking the door was a valid thing to be startled by, the grisly image on tv was bad, but I also didn‚Äôt see you react to these so if it‚Äôs a 24 hour fear all day over things you‚Äôre afraid of, you can seek therapy or help to manage stress better.\n\nWith all that said, I‚Äôm going to be honest, and I haven‚Äôt seen your husband‚Äôs reasons for why he thinks you‚Äôre the abusive one, but he sounds like a real shit head. I understand being overwhelmed and tired because of the day to day grind, but to just lash out at someone you love when they feel vulnerable is a fucking massive red flag. I know people in my family who push buttons when another person is feeling down and all it leads to is fights and broken relationships. The fact he can‚Äôt reassure you or at least make an effort to maybe call a neighbor is pathetic. Again, I lived on my own in college, I had to make noise complaints. I was always shy to do so, but my fucking sleep mattered. And while you probably should work on doing that for yourself, if I had a wife as anxious as you, I‚Äôd take one for the team and fucking call.\n\nIt sounds like he may possibly be exhausted from work and life responsibilities which is fair enough. But he shouldn‚Äôt treat you like this. He shouldn‚Äôt make you feel scared he‚Äôs not going to be there for you. If he knows you‚Äôre on the spectrum and have these mental hurdles, he should be empathetic to that. Seriously consider where you think this relationship is headed.

587,some manners I don't see the point of,"['manners', 'point']",wien8e,4,"['Saying please might seem like unnecessary effort. To the other person, passing the thing to you is unnecessary effort. Saying please is like quid pro quo. \n\n""I\'d like you to do something solely for *my* benefit. But I recognize it takes effort on your part, and I will therefore make a gesture of recognition and appreciation by making a symbolic reciprocal effort myself in the form of saying please.""  If I don\'t hear please I tell the person nope.\n\nThe bottom line is it makes people feel good. Same with hbd. Say it and mean it in order to live better.', 'You\'re right, logically manners aren\'t very useful - they don\'t seem to change the concrete facts of most situations. These are a few examples that may help you approach them differently:\n\n-If you fart around people, even accidentally, saying ""excuse me"" doesn\'t change that you did it. But it is a way for you to acknowledge that you\'ve done something unpleasant and apologize for it. By saying nothing, the physical situation is still the same but you aren\'t acknowledging the unpleasantness - implying that you have no problem with the people in your presence stewing in your funk. You can imagine which response is more socially advantageous. \n\n-With happy birthday, even though you acknowledged it was her birthday, by not saying ""happy birthday"" you aren\'t acknowledging the ""specialness"" of the day to her, implying that it\'s ""just another day"" to you - which again, logically is true, it being her birthday has virtually no bearing on the quality of your day. Even for people we just kind of know and aren\'t super close with, I don\'t think it\'s a big stretch to say that we at the very least wish them well on days that are special to them - we dont necessarily consider it a mutual special day, but the specialness to them is worthy of at least some positive energy from us. For me, I\'ve always felt that this kind of good will towards people I know was implied, but socially it is not. I think it\'s a mental shortcut my brain made to prevent me from having to wish people well. Similarly, my aspie dad never told my NT mom ""I love you"" (they ended up divorcing), and he justified it by saying ""I wouldn\'t have married you if I didn\'t love you"" - that may be true but she still would have liked to hear it.\n\n-Not saying ""please"" and ""thank you"" also implies entitlement. It\'s a way of acknowledging that whomever you are thanking/asking is going out of their way (even a little bit, and even if it\'s their job).\n\nLong story short, when you don\'t say the socially acceptable polite thing, you\'re sending a message that you are implying the opposite of the polite thing\'s meaning.', '¬Ø\\\\\\_(„ÉÑ)\\_/¬Ø', 'Put yourself in their position. You‚Äôd like it if someone said please and / or happy birthday to you vs not saying it. So there‚Äôs no point other than to make the other person feel good which will strengthen your bond with them.', 'Saying ""please"" and ""thank you"" are ways you show appreciation for what the other person does for you. Saying that to someone can make them feel much better and more appreciated, we even got a lot of extra food one time when ordering because my mom always wrote ""please"" and ""thank you"" when making an order, because no one else did that.\n\nIn a relationship it\'s also normal to say ""I love you"" to your partner regularly, even if it\'s obvious and repeating it seemingly serves no purpose. But it does, since it always reassures your partner and reminds them of that. Talking isn\'t just about giving and receiving blunt information, since the way you phrase it and your tone influences how the other person feels.\n\nWith stuff like ""happy birthday"" or ""good morning"" I can somewhat relate, even though I mostly still take the effort to say it. I just don\'t say ""good morning"" or ""good night"" to family members since I see them every day and also don\'t wanna talk in the morning. I agree that a lot of times it\'s just empty phrases people say because they feel like they have to, but often times there is more to it then that.', 'For please, it\'s kind of like a tone indicator...similar to how on this sub, everyone wants you to use ""/s"" when you\'re being sarcastic.\n\nThey\'re both unnecessary from the standpoint of minimal amount of words needed for full transfer of information. But they both help people to not be confused about what you really mean.\n\nFor birthdays, I think most of the stuff about birthdays sucks for autistic people. My theory is that whoever invented Jehovah\'s Witnesses was autistic, and was just really annoyed with all the societal conventions that come along with birthdays, because they don\'t celebrate birthdays at all.']",https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wien8e/some_manners_i_dont_see_the_point_of/

633,Help! Aspie boyfriend says he coddles me too much,"['aspie', 'boyfriend']",wh5b1i,91,"[""I feel like the whole problem here is about him not understanding the half jokes you make. One of the more common things for aspies is that they don't understand sarcasm, so he is taking what you're saying not as if you were joking. You could either clarify after making this type of half jokes that that was indeed only a joke. The other solution could be to avoid these half jokes completely or make them so obvious that he'll notice that you're joking.\n\nThe thing that confuses me and I don't have a solution for is that about him calling you a narcissist when he's angry, but then saying that he didn't mean it. I feel like this is just a coincidence that he also calls you a narcissist when you argue. I'm pretty sure that that's not because of that half joke you made.\n\nMaybe there's something about the way you talk when you argue that also makes him think you're narcissistic. Aspies I feel like always think logically and when emotions can and do change your way of thinking, like during an argument, he might be confused by your way of thinking.\n\nTalk to him about everything, tell him how you see it and how it makes you feel. Aspies often don't see hints you might give and talking instead of showing can make him understand your feelings a lot better.\n\nI hope this helped in any way :)"", 'Your bf reminds me A LOT of my father.

But you know what my best attribute is? (dramatic pause) That I\'m so incredibly modest."" When it came up as a subject, I tried to explain to my father that this was just a joke, but he\'d insist ""no, I truly think you\'re thinking this about yourself.""\n\nON THE OTHER SIDE\n\nThere\'s a fine line between not getting sarcasm and being an asshole. There are a lot of (not just ND) people, who have this attitude that emotional intelligence & empathy is for the weak. Not just ""idgaf about your feelings, snowflake"", but the mindset of ""I don\'t see value in emotional support/context"".\n\nMy father would generally feel offended about every ""irrational behaviour"" I had as a child. The typical ""why do you cry, it\'s not helping your situation"" instead of a hug. This ended in me being pretty much neglected. Not just in my feelings, just general. He even went as far, as to tell me he didn\'t love me when I was 10yo (generally, never understood the feeling) and getting angry why I was still hugging him. Even years later, he argues that this was the right behaviour, because ""What should I have done? Just lie to you?""\n\nFact is: You don\'t sound like a narcissist. His arguments and behaviour are ridiculous.

That's not just *you* (his girlfriend), that's *anyone*.\n\nYour request is perfectly reasonable IMO. He's allowed to feel however he feels (and the same goes for you). However, he needs to clearly understand that there are ways (and appropriate times and places) to express whatever he is feeling in a way that is respectful rather than accusatory.\n\n>wowww am i not the most stunning woman ever? Do you feel lucky to have such a stunning human as your girlfriend?\n\nFor this one, I might be able to explain where his head might be at. There's some things that would make this difficult for me as an aspie to give you the response you're looking for:\n\n1. Hyperbole can be objectionable to aspies who are used to direct, plain, (and sometimes unskillfully brutal) honest words.\n2. If he's like me, he may have a deep-seated fear about not wanting to stand out. If being on the spectrum has caused him a lot of suffering and he has learned to mask to fit in socially, drawing attention to oneself could be thought of as universally bad.\n3. As an aspie, I find myself in situations where there's an expected reaction to something, and I just don't feel it at all - whatever it is, it just doesn't resonate with me. (Example: I feel no empathetic joy at all when my friends get pregnant or have kids.) There may be a sense of shame because he doesn't feel the reaction you expect.\n\nHope this helps."", 'Does your BF actually know what narcistic disorder contains of, I wonder?\n\nIt seems like he simply uses the word for name-calling. Ofcourse that is not nice of him and naturally you can ask him not to do that. \n\nIt is then up to him to make a choice to adjust himself or not. That leaves him space to be himself.\n\nHowever, if it bothers you too much, he will have to live with the consequences of his behaviour: that you might be angry with him or even maybe not want to be in a relationship like that?\n\nNeither of you can force the other to behave differently.

Being in his position before, I would think that having to compliment you over and over (again, I don't know the frequency of this) could make him believe that you're disregarding whatever he previously said. It reminds me of when people ask a person for advice face to face, they get given it but never follow it.\n\nAs for calling you a narcissist, I don't think he means that.

Add on top of that that it can be very difficult for men to put themselves in the shoes of women, not just because our feet our bigger. It is also difficult for some ASD people to understand the meaning of ""put yourself in someone else\'s shoes"".\n\nI believe on average most men take significantly fewer selfies than women do, especially outside of a situation with their SO. Even when they do, the way they look in the photo is usually less important than why they\'re taking it - which is probably to make a record of where they are (gym, new restaurant, vacation, or something like that). They aren\'t going to worry too much about ""good lighting"", they might retake it once or twice if they smiled goofy or eyes were half closed, but they aren\'t generally going to focus on the details the same way as women do.\n\nSo being a male, he probably has a similar perspective as described regarding selfies, i.e. not being super concerned with them generally speaking. And because he has difficulty understanding your/female approach to them, and (assuming) without a similar struggle with insecurity about his looks, he probably doesn\'t understand the purpose of taking one and ""milking"" the result - as you said, the lighting is good, and you were feeling yourself and thought you looked pretty; absolutely nothing wrong with what you did or your feelings about how it turned out. \n\nSo for him to respond the way he did understandably completely took the wind out of your sails. He likely doesn\'t see how doing what your were doing was making you feel good because it wouldn\'t make him feel good. It\'s good that he admitted he needs to work on that, which tells me he\'s capable of applying some reasoning, which is: you, as his SO, are important to him and usually we want the people important to us to enjoy themselves and be happy. For you specifically, you feel happy when you are satisfied with your appearance and take a picture where you look cute - he needs to recognize that because of your image issues, this is a big confidence boost for you and he should encourage and support you when you feel good about yourself - you may need to explain his to him directly; personally I like receiving this kind of advice (even though NT person may take it as rude) because it gives me concrete context I didn\'t have previously for how to handle a situation.\n\nSecond point: ""narcissist"" gets incorrectly tossed around and interchanged with ""self-absorbed"" or ""vain"". If you were just annoyingly spamming selfies every 30 seconds the whole time I could see an accusation of vanity (not narcissism) being valid but this doesn\'t sound like it was the case. Narcissist is a pretty serious thing to call somebody, especially one\'s SO. He should do his research on what it actually is and get his terminology straight before throwing that term around. I would be beyond irritated if someone called me a narcissist especially just because of one action. \n\nI actually have a question for you, maybe we can trade advice: if my hypothetical SO showed me a selfie and asked me how lucky I felt to have such a pretty girlfriend, I would feel VERY put on the spot, even if I knew she was feeling happy and good about herself and how she looked in the photo. This is one of those situations where I have to kind of keep a response in my back pocket. Would something like ""not as lucky as you, have you seen me?"" Be a fun/witty response, or is it offensive because it drew attention away from her? Could I make it better by following up with ""jk, you look great in that picture, I love your (something I actually like about how she looks in it)!"" Is there a different way to respond to it? And/or, how were hoping him to respond?

I have never met people who are so sincere and true to who they are than people with Apsergers and autism in general. \n\nIn short, a lot of our issues make us fall short because we are different than others. If ""others"" did not exist, the amount of problems we have falls by quite a bit. In a world where you are the only person alive, social interactions are nonexistent. Your thinking skills have more opportunities to be put to good use. And you\'d never have to worry about masking or trying to fit in, which would alleviate so much stress and anxiety. \n\nIn a world where it\'s just people with autism, we would all be more understanding of each other. Society would be structured to accommodate so much better than it is now. While this may ruin the concept of ""thinking outside the box"" (because everybody would), social interactions I think would generally improve. We would be more mindful of each other. It\'s still hard for us to communicate with even each other, but there\'s be less pressure or need to mask or try to fit in still. \n\nThe scenarios I gave above are extremes. They will never happen.

Feel free to skip this if you just want to vent.  I get it.  They are the worst.\n\n1.  Humans need to cooperate at a level that few other wild animals do.  We are a hyper social species.   Between how helpless our infants are for long periods of time (years and years of care before they can start feeding themselves), and how much we need to pool resources to defend ourselves from predators and effectively find food, the extent that humans rely on one another is pretty remarkable.\n2.  Maintaining high degrees of cooperation is difficult.  Neurotypicals have developed tons of little tricks, mental heuristics, and social rules in order to survive and work together.  It‚Äôs really fascinating, and effective viewed from that angle.\n3.  Lying is one of these survival skills.  Like a weak monkey hiding an erection in front of dominant males, it is a way to keep society functioning by limiting shared information in order to focus on the important info.   Getting food and not getting beaten up is more important than getting laid, so why would that monkey share the fact that he‚Äôs feeling arousal?  Similar mechanisms are behind most lies.  \n3.  Most people don‚Äôt count lies to preserve frictionless social interactions as lies because they see it as supporting a greater truth.  The monkey in the previous example knows he hasn‚Äôt a chance against the dominant males so his erection will never effect his interactions.  He wont try to have sex with the females, so he‚Äôs not planning on fighting the males.  This doesn‚Äôt effect the life of the dominant males in any significant way, so keeping this information from the male is a win for him.\n4.  Often the dominant male is well aware of the erection.  It‚Äôs not a lie, per sae, but a polite fiction so that they can both side step the argument.  Dominant male doesn‚Äôt *want* to beat the snot out of the weak monkey with an erection.  If the monkey is hiding his erection, the dominant male can pretend to not see it and neither of them has to waste time with it.  If, however, everyone sees the erection, the dominant male has to beat him up because other monkeys will decide the dominant male is weak and he will lose his dominant status.  Hiding the erection makes everyone happy.  \n\n‚ÄúLying‚Äù means this giant group of monkeys can live together,  cooperate, and get better food.  It is a pro-social behavior.\n\nHumans are the same. \n\nIt‚Äôs frustrating for me, personally, because I don‚Äôt have the same instinctive awareness of ‚Äúpolite fictions‚Äù that Neurotypicals do.  I was unaware that when people were telling me they ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt have time‚Äù to spend with me that they were saying they didn‚Äôt want to.  They thought I was being deliberately obtuse because ‚Äúeveryone knows‚Äù what that means.  They were not being sociopaths.  They were being like the monkeys in the story.  They were lying in an obvious way to avoid the painful interaction.  I just wasn‚Äôt playing along, so from their point of view I was making everything unnecessarily painful.  \n\nI, personally, hate it.  I would rather people tell me the truth, even if it‚Äôs painful.  I try to encourage this behavior by being the most cheerful reject you will ever deal with.  I work really hard to not let my feelings get hurt by the truth so that scared NTs aren‚Äôt afraid to level with me.  \nThem:  you are being creepy.\nMe: thanks for the info.  I‚Äôll leave you alone.\n\nThem:  I hate this gift.\nMe: now I know what not to give you.  Thank you!\n\nThem: I am available on the nineteenth, I‚Äôd just rather have my eyes gouged out than go to your dinner party.\nMe:  thank you for your candor.  I will stop inviting you!\n\nBy letting them know I‚Äôm not going to be the angry dominant monkey who beats them up, they can stop hiding their figurative erection.  \n\nThat being said, I am lying a bit in these examples.  It does hurt my feeling a little, every time I hear this stuff.  But it shouldn‚Äôt‚Äîit‚Äôs the truth!  My feelings don‚Äôt change what is true, so I need to get over it.

I mentioned this on another post but I suggest being courteous to any staff you interact with in any establishment you visit.

Moreover, you grouped people who have ASD together and generalized us to look like saints or graceful animals. \n\nI don\'t think this is good. We can\'t assume everyone in a group is a certain way nor that they behave in certain ways. We also can\'t assume that people belonging to a group are like this based on only one genetic aspect that differentiates them from another group. \n\nNot all ASD patients are the same.

Of course it will offend a lot of people.\n\nOn the last paragraph: I saw a paper explaining a theory that says that autism is the opposite of schizophrenia. Schizofrenia is more frecuent in low developed countries, and this theory explains that by saying that schizophrenics are ""too social"", inventing social intercourses that don¬¥t even exists or taking social intercourses that are not related to them as related to them. This is caused because social intercourse is more neccesary when resourses (such as food, refugee or protection from predators) are scarse. Humans join to survive.\n\nWhen all the basic resourses are obtained, and the basic necessities are fulfilled, a part of the society can stop participating in this basic needs fulfillment (and so, they will no be very social individuals) and start producing technical and scientific advancements. This would explain the fact that autism is much more frecuent in well developed countries.\n\nApparently, it has to do with epigenetics. The genome is influenced by the amount of resourses during the embryonic development.', 'Let\'s unpack this a little. \n\nThe ""ancestor genes"" theory doesn\'t hold up so well, since a lot of families have both NT and ND people in them... I don\'t know what the ratio is, or if anyone ever studied this, but nearly all of us have some NT relatives.  \n\n""We"" are not ""anti-social"" though a few of us are at times in our lives.  ""We"" are differently social, with many of us missing social cues and non-verbal communication but if ""We"" were anti-social, there would be a lot less ""why can\'t I find friends/a girlfriend/etc."" on this sub and a lot more ""Great news!

They plus ""Us"" make up the full diversity of humanity, with every good and every bad trait humans bring to the table.  Some of them are lovely people, and some of them are total shits.

(dr will powers wrote a post about it on his subreddit recently, the ""tetrad of trans"" as he called it, trans people seem to be way more likely to have EDS, ADHD and ASD than cis people and he highlighted that some of the EDS, ADHD and ASD predisposition genes overlap with 21-steroid hydroxylase enzyme and other hormone metabolism enzyme genes that could influence gender dysphoria and non hetero sexualities in the 6p21 loci on chromosome 6, it is not proven, but it is an idea that makes sense)', ' is this a troll?

My partner and I have been together for 26 years. About ten years in, I realized he had Aspergers. I would get really frustrated by some of his habits and awkwardness when interacting with other people. Then a friend of mine pointed out to me that my partner might have Aspergers, which I had never heard of at the time. Not long after, my therapist also suggested that my partner may be on the spectrum. But I never said anything to him. I just kept it to myself. \n\nThen a few years later, he just happened to do an online test.

Quite often I hear him say, ""that\'s my adhd"" when talking to people, so it must be nice for him to put a label on it.\n\nNow we can address things better knowing why certain situations keep cropping up. It\'s also a lot more fun, we send each other adhd memes and comics.

It\'s been a similar revelation for myself, like wow damn that explains A LOT.\n\nI\'m now aware of things that stress me out and know I need to take action to manage them. I use to think I had a mood disorder or something because I\'d ""randomly"" get angry (now I know its overwhelm building and building). \n\nI also now understand why socialising is so damn stressful.

Years ago when I heard about someone being autistic, I visualized the usual traits (a \'disturbance\' basically). So if someone confronted me back then about me showing signs of autism, I probably would\'ve laughed and asked to be left alone.\n\nSo while I do understand where this is coming from, be careful.

I had worked with some of my friends for a year or so before they actually started being friends. https://www.mindbodygreen.com/articles/exactly-how-many-hours-it-takes-to-create-lasting-friendship/\n\nAlso, there needs to be emotional availability. You‚Äôre in a therapy group: the people there may not feel like making friends with others in the group or in general, they may want to focus on their own mental health. Not everyone is always open to new friendships.', ""I don't think there is a good definition for a 'true' friendship as an adult.  They are mostly based on reciprocity of one kind or another.  And they usually don't last very long, even for NTs.  That's what marriage is for.\n\nHaving said that, I'll gladly be friends with anyone and share special interests and give them honest feedback to improve social skills. And if they don't like me that's fine, they can just stop calling me and I will feel sad but I won't bother them any more.  We should be more supportive of each other as a community so that no one feels excluded or marginalized."", 'The best way is by being kind and helpful without being a people pleaser. This is more of a mental/mindset thing. Someone asks for help moving for example, are you jumping at the opportunity so you can get validation? Or do you genuinely want to help - would you feel comfortable asking this person for the same? Some benefit of the doubt may be necessary in a new friendship, but try to get a sense for this. Becoming some kind of platonic ""pick me"" is a good way to have friends who walk all over you. Ask me how I know.\n\nCan you give more insight into how you\'ve reached out to these people? I\'ve learned that we can sometimes feel so desperate for connection that the way we reach out for it has the opposite effect. Not promising I can help but I will try. \n\nPeople with similar interests and hobbies also can make great friends. They may only be your hobby buddy at first but this can escalate into being invited to dinner or to hang out and more.

We had a fun little rock trio and are still friends 16 years later, though we live in different states. Another very good friend of mine is a hobbyist woodworker like myself, and we have fun building stuff together - I\'ll be helping him design, build and install a custom walk-in closet in his new house (this project has a non-zero chance of being on HGTV).\n\nAlso, don\'t worry about some people you think you made friends with but never see again. Some friends are only meant to be in your life for a few hours or days, or in certain contexts.

901,Opinion: Giving other autistic people unsolicited advice to force eye contact to mask is ableist.,"['ableist', 'autistic']",wcctet,74,"['I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs ableist, it‚Äôs practical advice from people who have noticed a difference by doing certain things. There‚Äôs one guy in this sub who keeps going on about eye contact, but I do think he means well, even though at times the advice isn‚Äôt pertinent.\n\nI tend to advise against masking because it leads to burnout, but I also very much believe in hacks and finding the most efficient way through things. So, if looking at the bridge of a nose or a cheekbone is going to make my life easier at work or land me a job, I couldn‚Äôt care less, l‚Äôll look at your nose. Keeping my hands still ain‚Äôt going to happen and neither is stopping myself from stimming, but If slightly adjusting my body language or tone of voice means a better life‚Äôs quality, again, not an issue, and many NTs do it too. \n\nIt is not an issue for me, because I don‚Äôt find it hard, and I‚Äôd rather have an easier life and land the contract, than not look at someone‚Äôs nose since it doesn‚Äôt bother me at all. Having no money, bothers me much more.\n\nHowever, forcing myself to do social things like going to concerts, bars, pubs, festivals, crowded places, or drinking alcohol, to keep friendships or fitting in at work, that ain‚Äôt going to happen. If it‚Äôs an issue, then I‚Äôll find new friends or workplace. However, for someone else, with way less sensory issues than I have, that may be ok and it‚Äôs something they may recommend. \n\nBasically we all have different issues, my social issues are minimal compared to my sensory ones, for others it‚Äôs the other way round, and anyone‚Äôs advice is based on their own life experience. I think it‚Äôs unfair to accuse those who suggest eye contact of ableism, when it‚Äôs probably what worked for them and they‚Äôre just trying to be helpful in the only way they know. \n\nIn addition, pointing out that the vast majority of NT conversation is non-verbal is accurate and important to know. If you don‚Äôt want to adjust your body language, that‚Äôs a legitimate decision on the understanding you‚Äôre aware that a flat effect is going to impact your social interactions negatively. Some people don‚Äôt know that, so can‚Äôt understand why they‚Äôre having social issues. There‚Äôs a difference between knowing what is expected and ignoring that, despite the consequences, and not understanding why someone is being ‚Äúpunished‚Äù for breaking social conventions they didn‚Äôt even know existed.\n\nPlaying along with some silly social conventions isn‚Äôt condoning them or agreeing they‚Äôre right. A specific body language shouldn‚Äôt be needed, but the reality is that in most cases appearance and demeanour will make a difference. I was homeless, l‚Äôve been hungry, I‚Äôll do whatever it takes to never experience that, while at the same time taking every opportunity to educate people on the issues we face, since I‚Äôm very open about my diagnosis, so that future autistic generations can hopefully have an easier life. Others don‚Äôt want to conform, even it means negative consequences in their life‚Äôs quality, and that‚Äôs fine too. We are all different.', 'Some of us want to or NEED to be able to mask and blend in to function in the world and give ourselves better opportunities.   \n\nI wish I had learned how much easier being able to exchange social pleasantries would make things and how important the human factor was in business at 20 instead of learning the hard way over the years and finally getting it in my mid 30s.\n\nIf you want to make the world accept you and adapt to you you‚Äôre going to fight an uphill battle.', 'No it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs called training. \n\nI‚Äôve had tremendous problems with eye contact in my life and don‚Äôt so much anymore. The only reason for this is that I challenged myself enough. \n\nYes it‚Äôs uncomfortable. But a life spent in the comfort zone is a life wasted. \n\nEven though we‚Äôre autistic, we can still improve on our weaknesses.', ""Over the years I've trained myself to engage in eye contact during conversation for longer periods gradually. Even NTs don't do it all the time so I can get away with it.\n\nMy rationale is that as a man, some other men may not respect or trust someone who won't look them in the eye (a possible sign of untrustworthiness or submission) so I do it in order for them to see me as an equal. I'm not saying that I'm right in doing that but that's my incentive to continue doing it"", 'I don‚Äôt think stimming and avoiding eye contact is in our nature. \n\nStimming is something most people do and learn to limit. An asperger, being partially blind to the mechanics of social interaction, could not notice that, or could find limiting or masking stimming harder than someone else because it is used as a way to ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù and an asperger could have a higher than average need for that.\n\nEye contact could become more comfortable with practice, but this can be hard because usually it follows instincts that could not be well developed in us.\n\nNowadays people have often the advantage of being aware of asperger at a young age, but this awareness would be better used as a tool for improving our lives and build a social environment trying to not be too overwhelmed, not as something to use to limit ourselves drawing lines between us and others that don‚Äôt exist. Masking is something every human do to some extent, asperger or non-asperger everyone has to find a balance that works them and can sustain their own needs and aspirations.\n\nMasking doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean repressing, with practice people can mask something to look as something else, while still benefitting from what they are masking.', 'I always use the excuse that I have bad hearing, and tinnitus etc so people don‚Äôt mind if I look them in the mouth to lipread instead of eyes.\n\nMy hearing isn‚Äôt bad (though I do have tinnitus), but when there is more than 2 or 3 conversations in a room (I work in a pub, so all the time) it is incredibly difficult to focus on what that person is saying.', 'Is someone has a problem, and post here for answers, then answers they should get.

It is harder for some if us than others. If you don‚Äôt want to use eye contact as a skill for improved success- don‚Äôt do it. That is your choice. \n\nThose of us that have developed that skill and seen major improvement in professional and personal interaction and then encourage others due to our proven success are not ableist. No need to label. You would reject any label I tried to tag you with. \n\nYes it is uncomfortable at first but after desensitizing and practice it is not disconcerting nor anxiety provoking. \n\nKeep your labels so you can rationalize your behavior- let others do as they like as well.', 'I personally mask A LOT. I haven‚Äôt told most of my friends that I have autism. And it is a very conscious choice I have had to make, because it sadly proved to make my life A LOT easier. However I would probably only recommend masking, if someone is asking about it or want to learn how.', 'Masking is a tradeoff, and it\'s more of a cost-benefit decision:\n\nHow much effort (cost) does this masking require?  How much easier will my interactions with NTs be if I mask this way (benefit)?\n\nNote that this varies by individual and things that are easy for one ND person are hard or impossible for another. \n\nSo if Person A can get by more easily by taking a shower and getting a haircut, and the benefit she gets is being able to hold a job and pay bills, that\'s a pretty easy choice. \n\nIf Person B has to constantly monitor every word she says, every blink, every movement, every facial expression, only to find that the boss wants her to ""act more naturally around your coworkers""... that\'s not working.\n\nYou might be confusing ""ableism"" (new term, those of us who have been around a while aren\'t used to it!) with ""acting in one\'s own best interests"".    As a disabled person, I have the right to decide if I mask or not based on my own best interests and those of people I care about.  Wouldn\'t it be ""ableist"" to say that I can\'t?  \n\nThings get stickier when it\'s someone else (parent of adult Aspie) who wants their young adult to be self-sufficient saying, you need to take a shower, get a haircut and get a job. A lot of the younger folks here have trouble relating to the idea of being out of the parents\' home permanently (except visits of course) right out of college, or sooner, or that the parents have a right to think about/save for their own retirement at some point when their kid reaches a certain age.', 'Eye contact is an important social skill that helps you connect with other people. I always avoided eye contact, and for many years.\n\nWhen I finally started purposefully making eye contact, I found that strangers sometimes smiled at me. I was being seen in the world, and participating in it, and people were being nice to me.\n\nIf one of the main problems with autism is being disconnected from the rest of the world, eye contact is one of the small things that can legitimately make that better. And learning it is very possible.\n\nActing like autism is a ticket to never improving your social skills, is very harmful. Developing emotional intelligence and social skills is important for making friends and living a happy life.', 'yeah, I\'ve always felt the same way. I\'ve seen a lot of people saying ""just watch the middle of someone\'s eyebrows"" ""watch their nose"" or whatever, without me asking for advice. I\'ve always hated unwanted advice', 'I definitely agree the forced eye contact thing is bad advice. I generally think most advice given to autists about intergrating better with NTs is bad advice. Ableist tho? It\'s beginning to be like anything I don\'t like is ""ableist"" around here. It\'s like just something you say rather than having any real meaning. \n\nMost people don\'t understand what is autism, and thats about the extent of it. That doesn\'t make them ableist.', ""OP is right. If eye contact doesnt bother you, great. However, I hate it. Others feel the same.\nAlso, I am a girl and it is exactly the same as people telling me to just adapt to misoginy by accepting it, playing my contrieved womanly role because it will make my life easier. It's terrible advice, makes sense only if you are in survival mode, which I understand.\nI know it can be hard to face the fact that you've probably been mistreated your whole life."", 'Mmm well the way i think since im in the minority, its my place to conform. The healthy population is majority for a reason. I dont want to cause confusion because of the disability, and for me, a nuisance for me is much less of an overall negative than the fact if i would not mask and cause others confusion. The way i see masking is that a few of us might have negative effects,but overall many more (normal people) have not.', 'I\'m NT, my son is autistic. I mask often in social situations in order to maintain  status quo or to endear myself to people I am not comfortable with.  It\'s a means to an end of having a social life even though I would prefer less interaction most of the time.  But for my son, if he had the eye contact aversion, I would recommend looking at either the bridge of the nose or the area right between the eyebrows of the person he was speaking to in order to maintain a semblance of societal expectations.  My perspective is if this social trick can allow most of the population feel comfortable with him socially, life will exponentially easier than if he\'s viewed as ""other.""  I don\'t know if that should be viewed as \'right\' or \'wrong\' but if it makes life easier, then why not go with it?', 'Oh stfu.\n\nJust because you don‚Äôt like something doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs an: ist, ism, or phobia.', 'Yeah. Its like I\'d prefer not to make much eye contact. It hurts my eyes and I am an independent person which means its not that important that I impress somebody.

I know it's hard but it's doable."", 'What do you consider solicited versus unsolicited? Is someone posting about a problem they\'re having a solicitation to advice? I would personally say yes, but perhaps you disagree. I only ask because I happen to see quite a few posts on the subreddit along the lines of ""nobody likes me and I have no friends"".\n\nWell . . . There\'s a workaround for that . . . You know I think everyone has a right to choose whether or not they want to mask to make themselves more palatable to the wider world, but you cant decide not to and then complain of the consequences.  That\'s like deciding you\'re going to be a lion tamer and then complain when you get bit.  We know what people are. We how they were respond to us if we don\'t cloak ourselves in a field of normality. Yes, in a perfect world, people would be more accepting but we all know that we do not live in that world so we have a simple binary choice.  Either decision has consequences and you have to live with those consequences. If you choose to whine about them after the fact, don\'t be surprised when someone points out to you that you had a choice.\n\nThat\'s not being an ableist that\'s just being a realist.

Some interests are relatively short, others may last a decade or more, and some have been life-long.

I like to research, and to bring order to a chaos of new information. I have to understand how things are related to each other.\n\nThe other common theme is hyper focus. For a while, the new interest will be the most important thing in life for me. Other things are ignored. I forget to eat and drink. I dont look after myself. I ignore personal relationships. I get annoyed if I am interrupted.\n\nI've learned to control or mitigate some of the negative impacts as I've got older.\n\nFrom my own reading into adults with ASD, I think it is not the nature of the interest per se which is the autistic trait, but rather the way in which an interest impacts how you deal with day to day life."", ""I have Asperger's and ADHD and you perfectly described me.

Other people are present in the conversation all the time. Not as much with words as with their mimics and body language they show their participation in the conversation EVERY SINGLE SECOND. Autistic folk don\'t do that (we often have this unemotional expression or intense look which makes people accuse us of being cold or stuck-up or just weird).\n\nThen all of a sudden we have something to say and want to chime in. Of course, it\'s hard for people to flip attention on you when you looked not quite present a moment ago. You can fake interest and animation, of course, and some do it quite well.\n\nSecond, but less important is being assertive.

Its especially hard for autistic people to do this because group conversations tend to move at a much more rapid pace compared to one on one conversations where the pacing is controlled only by two people responding to each other. Its especially hard because autistic people tend to filter and review their responses before expressing it out. We do this because first we lack confidence and second we just don\'t want to appear weird, we want our replies to be appropriate and understood properly. The issue is this literally takes quite some time, its only split seconds to us, but the group conversation moves much faster than that and by the time you are ready with your response, the group has already moved on to another subject. This leads the autistic person to quite literally be left behind and in the end just end up being silent in the corner listening to everyone instead. Its especially more difficult not only because of the pace, but because its so ""dynamic"", for example the group could start with one subject where everyone is responding to one specific subject, but somewhere down the line based on the different responses , there could be another subject created in which now the group is split into two or more where people are still conversing about the main topic mainly, but also addressing specific individuals about something else on top of the other conversation. Its a very ""messy"" situation for an aspie person to navigate around and only practice can really prepare them on how to work this. A lot of focus is required and more subroutines in not only creating/preparing multiple responses, but on how and when to deliver them as well. Its sucks that to an aspie this is quite literally all manually done inside our heads and not instinctive, which is why it takes so much energy out of us when we are done with these conversations.\n\nNow the second thing is confidence. Even if you have mastered when to respond and the rate at which you prepare your response, you still need to express it with with great confidence. Because when you respond you are putting yourself on the spotlight, people are listening to you whether you see it or not. Even if they do not respond to you, they heard you. So you do have to present your response confidently. You cannot just blurt it out of nowhere while not even making eye contact with anyone and just standing stiff. Because in a group setting, you do need to look at multiple people while you\'re speaking to let them know you are engaging with them. You also need to make specific body gestures that are appropriate to your response and as well as creating expressions in your face. You also need to be prepared to respond back quickly when someone directly engages with your response to avoid looking, well dumb. You are putting yourself in this dynamic pool. In many ways it is almost like a battlefield where you have to  strategize your approach in this ever changing environment. It takes a great deal of mental ""Stamina"" to keep up. Group settings is perhaps one of the hardest things for an aspie to navigate in. It takes quite a lot of practice and nothing else can prepare you for it honestly.\n\nBravery is key. Putting yourself out there in those group chat situations. But the issue is we often shy away from them because of lack of confidence and have thoughts that we might look too ""awkward"" or ""weird"" when we put ourselves under that group spotlight. But not understanding that just standing silently in the corner is what looks weird already. You have to conquer that fear and ""engage"" no matter how weird you might sound at first. It is the only way to learn, practice and eventually master it.\n\nI\'m so glad that after many years I have finally gained the confidence to be in most conversations. It opens up a lot especially in certain group setting where it is so crucial to integrate like in your work life for example. It literally makes your work life worse when you are not part of the group because for example you might walk into the lunch room and everyone is conversing as a group and you just sit there alone. In that case you might even become the subject of ridicule like ""Why is that guy always silent, what\'s his deal"", or when people often group up trying to converse and figure out work related issues, you need to integrate yourself into those conversations otherwise your work is literally now affected if you don\'t.  In any work setting I have been in, you always need to be part of the group unless you want your entire time there being an experience in hell. You need friends, teammates. We have one person like that right now where I work. We do try to engage with him but he just doesn\'t want to engage back at all, and now his work performance is being affected because we cannot effectively communicate with him and teach him proper ways of doing things. He kind of just does his own thing and now he is seen as an incompetent worker and I do believe it is a lot to do with him not engaging with us and figuring out the efficient way of doing what we do. We still try and hep him but I honestly think he\'s too arrogant to care or listen. Sad but what can you do. He sits by himself at lunch, he doesn\'t talk in the locker rooms, he doesn\'t try to understand problems and solutions directly related to our work that we talk about as a group. It\'s not good honestly to work like that. Work is already tough, you need to make friends to make it easier and survive in the workplace.', 'Just start talking.

Forty years ago, not many people had a very great understanding of the range of LGBT+ identities or the social issues that those people experienced. Today, while there\'s still desolate corners of society who insist on abusing those they think they can abuse, most people have been made aware of LGBT+ issues to at least a basic degree, and consequently, more people now respect LGBT+ people and make an effort to make space for them in broader society.\n\nI believe that ASD communities can learn from minorities who have already gained ""a place in the spotlight"", and gain allies both among other minorities, and among those who want to be good, but still haven\'t been made aware of all the people they\'re hurting - which, I believe, is a very large portion of the people on this planet.\n\nEDIT: Thanks so much for the Wholesome award, I really appreciate it! <3', 'The behavioral changes make us ""annoying, creepy, etc."" to others, so no sympathy.', '> It just tells me that they don‚Äôt actually care about anything they preach\n\nCorrect.', 'Because most of it is done to gain credit with their particular social circle.

Find something funny or beautiful. Again, if it‚Äôs comfortable, if it works in your area, go outside and try to find a way to feel connected to the broader community of life. Do you hear birds? Do you see squirrels or butterflies or ladybugs? Is there a big, wise tree you can get close to? Look for the wind moving tall grasses or flowers.
