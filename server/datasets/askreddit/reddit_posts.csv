Its a brain fog. \n\nYounger men have a shorter refractory period than older men (In most instances before some dude says ""well not me""), so if you want to keep the party going you\'re going to have to take the wheel so to speak for at least a few minutes while a guys head gets flushed of those chemicals and he\'s back in the game. \n\nBest tip, either tell him what to do for 2-3 minutes and he will, or enjoy kissess and cuddles for 2-3 minutes but make it clear you want service to resume. \n\nWithout direction, this is also the time men are most commonly known to fall asleep, because they are enjoying cuddles, full of happy chemicals and if not getting the signal from their partner to keep things going then they will just shut off. \n\nSo in short, this is a biological reaction, if more ladies are aware of it and just work through those couple of minutes guys are usually back in form for more longer fun.', ""We don't control erections most of the time"", 'You can get a couple extra drops out if you treat it like a toothpaste tube.

The Parthenon in Athens is devoted to Athena's virginity (both her birth and own status).  It's entirely possible the entire concept of Virgin Mary didn't come along until after she died.\n\nEdit: I'm neither a Buddhist nor religious scholar.  The version of Buddha's birth I learned about in High School involved his mother having a dream of a white elephant and giving birth through her side.  It was an off hand example, there's plenty of others."", 'It explains why 3 strange men arrived with gifts', 'Nothing would change. People are going to believe what they want to believe.', 'She was like 13, more likely someone just raped her and the family made up a story about immaculate conception.', 'The first gospel (Mark) wasn’t written till 35 years after Jesus’ death. Who knows if Mary ever claimed anything', ""So, this is one of those theories that keeps coming up, with various answers as to what actually was being hidden. The one thing they have in common though, is the idea that Mary actually ever claimed to have had a virgin birth. That's... not what the evidence actually suggests, though.\n\nThe story does feature in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, and those were emphasized especially in early Christianity, because of the implications for the debate about Christs divinity and humanity.\n\nBut neither the Gospel of Mark, nor the Gospel of John, or even the Pauline Epistles mention anything of the sort. John straight up asserts Joseph to be the father of Jesus twice, and they make a bit of a thing of Jesus being related to King David *through Joseph*.\n\nIn this context, it's important that John and Mark were written substantially earlier than Luke and Matthew, which makes it substantially more likely they're incorporating Greek and Roman tropes of miraculous births, than that they had some information on Jesus' birth that John and Matthew didn't have.\n\nNow, if you read the Bible as the infallible word of God with no possibilities of contradiction, then it's easier to dismiss John's claims about Joseph than Matthew and Mark's claims about Mary, so the Virgin Birth becomes dogma.\n\nBut if you see the Bible as a historical text that relies heavily on an oral tradition, before being written down more or less definitively by various people at various times, then it becomes wildly unlikely that the claim of Virgin Birth originated during the times of Jesus and Mary themselves."", '""Christianity: A coverup for an affair that\'s gotten way out of hand.""', 'Or what if none of it ever even happened and its just a story plagiarized from dozens of other mythologies, religions and cultures by somebody who wasnt there in an attempt to amalgamate a vast, broken and spiritually divided empire.', ""I mean that's probably exactly what happened."", ""What if all of the bible is a lie? I mean. According to the Bible a man and his son's built a boat that was big enough to hold a male and female of every single animal on the planet.\n\nLet's dig a little deeper into that. Not only did they supposedly build this enormous boat, but they also harvested all of the materials necessary to build it as well. These people lived in the desert. They lived in adobe homes. Yet somehow managed to cut down and process all of the wood necessary to build this big ass boat. 5 guys. \n\nAnd if that's really not enough food for thought, our hero then went on to round up a male and female of every single animal in THE ENTIRE WORLD! I have a challenge for you. Why don't you go round up a male and female animal of one wild species and get them to hop in your car. Let me know how that goes."", 'Lots of experts on Gnosticism and Christian history in the comments section', 'Bruh we need to get the story of the father of jesus then and his epic journey to buy milk', 'There\'s a huge plothole in your theory. Joseph, at first, was willing to quietly end their relationship in order to save her great shame or perhaps even stoning. However, an angel appeared to him in a dream and explained how it was that Mary was pregnant and so he stayed with her.\n\n""Joseph, her husband, being a righteous man, and not willing to make her a public example, intended to put her away secretly. But when he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, ""Joseph, you son of David, don`t be afraid to take to yourself Mary, your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. She shall bring forth a son. You shall call his name JESUS, for it is he who shall save his people from their sins.""', ""I think it would be easier to deny the reliability of the gospel accounts altogether. If you try to get the idea that she lied out of the text it just doesn't work.\n\n First, noone was just taking Mary at her word. Joseph was preparing to quietly divorce her before he was visited by an angel which testified to the veracity of her claim. Then Zechariah was visited by an angel which proclaimed that his wife Elizabeth would become pregnant with a son who would prepare the way for the arrival of the Messiah.  Elizabeth was advanced in age and saw her pregnancy as a miracle of God. Mary's testimony carried less weight than that of the angelic beings.\n\nSecond, Mary was a Jewish woman in a thoroughly jewish society; claiming you were impregnated by God wouldn't get you out of trouble but make it even worse. Making such a claim would likely be considered blasphemous and would bring more shame and possibly worse. It just doesn't make sense to make up such a lie.\n\nFinally, even if we grant that Mary did lie and managed to deceive everyone around her, is that really enough to explain Jesus? Did Mary tell the luckiest lie ever? She claimed her son was conceived miraculously though a virgin birth, in an attempt to hide her infidelity and managed to give birth to possibly the most consequential person to ever live. Jesus's life and teachings have shape the course of history for the last 2000 years. I mean she may have been a big old liar but she must've been one heck of an amazing mother! She claimed her son was born miraculously and he actually grew up in such a way as to make that claim seem plausible."", 'So fun fact.

It's helped alot, haven't hurt myself (physically) or other (emotionally) in a very very long time."", 'DBT training has a fair amount of skills based training on how to control your emotions in tense situations.\n\n1. Try ""opposite emotions"" as a strategy to counteract anger. It is as simple as smiling or laughing when angry. Make the necessary faces, tell yourself (think about) your funniest joke. In the moment, there is nothing to laugh about but by forcing yourself to laugh (no bitter sarcastic laughing) and then trying to feel genuinely amused, the anger loop can be broken. Keep it wholesome - we all want to be good people and live healthy and happy lives with meaningful relationships.\n2. Be distinctly aware of the other person\'s emotions. Many people have mirror neurons that cause them to react to other people\'s emotions . A friend who shows feelings of happiness often brings out similar feelings of happiness in those nearby. Unfortunately this also applies to anger and aggression bringing out similar feelings of anger and aggression in the surrounding participants. Be aware, cultivate a spidey sense that is careful not to  get sucked in to other people\'s torment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(3) The following will not stop a full blown anger episode but it can prevent the next outburst. For this to work, practice the skills everyday until auto-pilot takes over. This can take time (months or even years) as changing core personality traits do not happen overnight. They take years to establish and they may take similar time to improve.\n\nWhen in a tense situation, the number one goal should be downvote the reactive (emotional) brain\'s response and upvote the proactive (thinking) brain\'s response to keep cool and maintain rational thought with control of one\'s emotions. Easier said than done but not impossible.\n\nTo stay cool in a tense situation use ODP with NOE.\n\nODP:  Observe, Describe, and Participate while practicing No judgement, One mindfulness with Effectiveness.\n\nO- Observe the situation. Pause your brain and observe what is happening. It is hard to be an observer when directly involved but try to act like an observer to the situation without immediately responding to the stress.\n\nD - Describe the situation. Use words to describe the facts about what is happening. Practice being a newspaper reporter that is only interested in covering the factual part of the story.  Reporters do not want to be in the headlines - they are watching and describing the events as they unfold. This can be especially difficult when people attack one\'s values - then it becomes personal. One way to mitigate these attacks is to practice benign interpretation. Don\'t judge - just stick to the facts.\n\nParticipate  -  Once the situation has been observed and described without emotional reactions then choose to participate without making the situation worse or simply not participate and walk away. It takes two people to argue. Don\'t respond if it is not a healthy situation to begin with.\n\nPracticing NOE while following the three steps above.\n\nN - No Judgement. This can be very challenging but lose the judgment. Judgement can lead to underlying resentment which is poisonous to healthy relationships. Simply put - be the bigger person.\n\nO - One mindfulness. Practicing mindfulness every day (5 - 15 minutes only) will help to keep calm when things are going crazy. Mindfulness is like an emergency stop on a freight train barreling down the hill. During a crisis, maintain control thru deep breathing exercises and briefly clearing your mind of negative runaway thoughts. Be aware of your emotional response, notice the small things  - like a train slowly picking up speed downhill,  apply the brakes ASAP not at the last moment. Practicing mindfulness every day will make it easier to find a calm state of mind in tense situations.\n\nE - Effective - Is my response going to be effective? This skill is about recognizing appropriate time and place.  Am I making the situation better or worse? This is not the time to think I am 100% in the right so I will defend my position. Nope - you can walk away.  Many difficult situations can be resolved at another time and place when people have calmed down. Sometime people need to get it out of their system and once they have calmed down you can participate in an effective manner. Don\'t waste your energy if you are not going to be effective.\n\nNote this skill set is not going to work every time. You are going to be get upset. Consider it more like a batting average that you are improving. Changing your response in tense situation takes time and the change is often measured in small degrees of change rather than a complete 180 in how you react! Stay positive and next time you will do better.\n\nThese relationship skills require practice - you can not just pull them out when you are raging.\n\nAn easy way to practice is to make it a habit to use them once every day, especially in situations where you are not directly involved. Write down your feelings about the experience so that your brain can internalize the process.\n\nOnce you have a routine established during safe events your brain can adapt and you will stay calm!', 'Get a diary.

A lot of women get the munchies (sweet and salty snacks nearby can be handy).  Most peeps, men and women, should be encouraged to hydrate and pee-post coital to prevent UTIs.  A fluffy and soft towel nearby for cleanup is a good idea.  The more luxurious the towel, the better.  Yes it is going to be used for filthy things, but the better the towel the more it makes cleaning up after seem a bit more dignified, lol.\n\nThen, depending on how interactive the person is after sex, good things to do: affirmations.  Affirm your love/how sexy they are/how good it felt.  Doesn\'t have to be a conversation even.  Sometimes you can express your contentment, love and satisfaction with body language and cuddles, so shape the post coital stuff to a place where you and your partner are on the same page with preferences and emotional needs getting met for both partners.  Check in with your partner, if it is like round 1 of three you are feeling up for that night, say the things you liked, ask them the things they liked.  Especially do this if you guys were having particularly kinky sex.  It is a way put a safety barrier between role play and the normal relationship/marriage. \n Encourage them to express themselves in a safe and discreet manner, where they know they are in a trusted, safe place without judgement or negativity.  Reinforce the bond/private nature of what just happened unless of course y\'alls are exhibitionists and were live streaming that shit or disturbing the neighbors but for most it helps peeps get more out of sex. \n\nA more normal routine for sex for me: immediately after usually just a ""Holy shit that was amazing."" Followed by a kiss and holding each other for a bit.  After calming down if she wasn\'t immediately falling asleep offer a Gatorade or some water from the mini-fridge after grabbing one for myself.  Dirty talk or affectionate talk or whatever was on her mind.  Compliment the things she did well.  Tell her how sexy she is.  Excuse myself to go brush my teeth/pee, go back in for a cuddle, let her do the same.  More cuddles, talking about random stuff plans or whatever is on her mind.  Draw figures on her back or play with her hair until she falls asleep if she likes more physical affection, talking about relaxing things if she\'s more verbal.  Fall asleep, wake up, make breakfast proportional to how good the sex was.  Wild off the walls sex?  Furniture was broken, we had a noise complaint from the neighbors and the police stopped by?  Bish getting some crepes, hell a multi-course breakfast in bed with some nice coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice.

This guy tried to sleep with me and I told him no (I was a virgin at the time) so he started dating my best friend (the Bible thumper) and took her virginity then told her he slept with me. She believed it and was super distant with me. When I confronted her about it she said it was because I slept with her boyfriend. I told her no I didn’t would never do that to her. She said because he had my nudes (they weren’t actually mine when she showed me the pictures) that it must be true. So I told her those weren’t even my nudes and her boyfriend was full of shit and she was an idiot for believing a guy she’s known for a couple months over her best friend she’d known for 8 years. The next day she told everyone I slept with her boyfriend. The only person who believed I didn’t do it was my boyfriend because that who I lost my virginity to so the timeline didn’t even add up. \n\nSecond girl - She dated this guy they broke up and I started dating him.

I overslept the next day and missed the bus. She goes to the school and tells them I’m not at school because I’m trying to kms. The school shows up asking me to explain I tell them what’s she’s been saying. They drove me to the school and took pictures of the messages she sent me. They decided I’m a danger to myself and called my mom and cps and drove me to the hospital and told them I was trying to kms. The hospital checked my body and ran tests and decided I need therapy or they were going to take me away from my mom. A few years later the same girl told the school I had a knife in my purse to kms with. So the school searched my purse and found my prescription of iron with my name on it and expelled me for having narcotics on school property.\n\nLast person - I was best friends with this guy who was bisexual. He broke with ex and we started dating. The ex got so mad we were dating. He started being my “friend” (weren’t really friends only knew him because he was dating my best friend) then gets his cousin to threaten to beat me up. I can fight so I wasn’t scared till she realized she couldn’t beat me up she started saying she was going to unalive me. And told me to meet her at this place so she can do just that.

Literally, multiple times a day. He\'s seriously woken me up from deep sleeps before while doing this. \n\nWe work together and were acquaintances at first. He owns the house me and two other guys live in, he used to live there. I guess he\'s our ""landlord."" He decided to move out and in with his fiance. Still uses the house we all live in to store shit. We can\'t use the shed because all of his shit is in there, which is fine; however, he still has a bunch of shit in the house. He shows up randomly with his fiance and their child (both lovely) and will just stay on the couch for the weekend, unannounced. Sometimes forces the other roommate to watch their kid while they have a date night. All three of us, combined, pay **way** above his mortgage payments. I\'m not paying what I pay to live in a fucking storage building.  \n\nKeeps a short bus at the house that he\'s apparently renovating into a camper. There are tons of bus chairs currently sitting in the driveway. Roommates and I have bets on how long they will be there.  \n\nHe slams doors. He leaves doors open (we have a cat and live next to a busy highway. Cat is an indoor cat).  \n\nWhen he lived there and even when he comes for his weekend stays he just totally trashes the house. Leaves dishes everywhere. The dishes he manages to bring back into the kitchen he just throws in the sink instead of a) cleaning them or b) rinsing them and putting in the dishwasher. A clean kitchen is a big deal to my one roommate and I as we both love to cook.  \n\nSince he doesn\'t allow us to use the shed to store shit, we cleaned the back room where the water heater and stuff is, installed shelves, organized it with our shit that we don\'t/can\'t keep in our room. He comes in, thrashes it, puts his damn kids folding crib in there to put him down for a nap then gets mad when one of us have to go in there to either a) grab something from the deep freezer (as I mentioned, two of us love to cook) or b) have to grab something like TP/paper towels as we keep all of our household items there (e.g. this past weekend I wanted to go paddleboarding; he got mad because I went back there to get my paddleboard).    \n\nYears ago he set up a POS inflatable jaccuzi in the backyard. it\'s been deflated ever since.

He sat, hungover, all day Sunday and didn\'t do shit.  \n\nHe\'s just loud and has to brag about everything. I came home Friday night and he just went off about how he cut down trees and rode horses all day on Friday. Then roommate #1 came home so he had to tell him the same exact story. Then to roommate #2. All of this in a span of an hour, just following people around the house yammering away. I could hear him from upstairs telling roommate #2 the same exact story even with my door closed and a box fan on.  \n\nMy overall, uneducated assumption and armchair psychologist thought on him is he has grown up his whole life with his mom cleaning up after him and wiping his ass every step of the way. He\'s a ""mormon"" (though he drinks and has premarital sex) and a lot of those values still follow him.

You've missed so much that I wish you could've been here for."", 'When I was a student teacher, there was a grade 8 student who I didn’t teach, but was good friends with a student I did teach. She was very talented, got straight A’s in school, was amazing on the piano, and an excellent badminton player. I didn’t know her well but she came in to my classroom occasionally to hang out with her friend. \n\nThe following year I was at a different school. I received news that she committed suicide. A few months later, a teacher at the same school suddenly died to an aggressive cancer. The school was crushed. I couldn’t believe it and although I didn’t know the student well, I wish that I made those minutes where I was in the same room with her more meaningful.\n\nLots of teachers applied out that year just to get away from everything. I reconnected with some teachers who used to teach there. One of them still cries when she thinks back to that year.\n\nAs I reflect on that, I think about the 150+ kids that I teach a year. How many of those come from challenging home situations, have mental health crisis, feel lonely, etc? How can I make those minutes with them count so that they can look back and remember that someone cared about them?\n\nThe summer of this year was the year that those grade 8’s from when I was a student teacher have graduated high school. A student from that cohort sent me a long message, thanking me for buying her lunch when she didn’t come to school with food, for pulling her aside during class when she was upset to talk about life, buying pie on pi day, etc. It reminded me that as much as I often get stressed about curriculum, that at the end of the day, students don’t really remember what you taught them nearly as much as how you made them feel. I still have the old habit of getting way too stressed out if I am behind schedule on curriculum, or getting pissed at students who aren’t ready yet to be polite, but when I think back on everything, it helps me remember that we’re all just trying to deal with our own stuff and I can be better by meeting them where they’re at.', ""A related question (sorry I'm not answering the question) is: how is a student's suicide dealt with these days? I was in high school in the 80s and a kid committed suicide. He had a twin brother too. No one ever talked about it openly, no teacher ever said a word about it, just word got around by whispered rumor. I wasn't close to his twin but in classrooms it was just an awkward absence that no one ever mentioned."", 'This is so far the most perfect question for me in this sub.\n\nBack in 2017, I had a student who was very close to me, dear to my heart. When he left our school, he kept on visiting me. We always kept in touch, sending messages and memes to each other. Until one night, he just sent me a message and asked me if I would hate him. He didn\'t say why.\n\nWe often talk about silly things, so I didn\'t know what was up. I told him ""I may or may not hate you for the same reason,"" then I dropped my phone, watched TV, and the night went on. Little did I know he sent a message telling me that he couldn\'t do it anymore and thanked me for everything.\n\nI was stunned. I sent him messages, called him, fumbled through my old contacts to trace his parents (I was his class adviser), and his friends. I found out he sent two others the same message, the same thing he sent me that night.\n\nThe next morning, we confirmed that he took his own life using his father\'s gun, shooting himself.\n\nIt was really devastating and chaotic. I blamed myself for not being there, for not seeing the signs, for turning a blind eye. I should have seen it in the poems he wrote, in the messages he sent, in the wounds he once showed me when he was still alive. I was there when his father dismissed my concern about him being sad and missing his sister, telling me that he should understand his sister was busy.\n\nIn my country, mental health services and therapy aren\'t common. Young people are left to suffer on their own. He was one of them. I grieved for years. He took his own life days before his birthday, and his birthday was a day before mine.\n\nHis parents never spoke to me after that. Even to his friends, especially his father. He blamed them for everything, perhaps, including me. I never got the courage to face him and tell him that he didn\'t listen to me when I told him about his son.\n\nUntil this day, I grieve. His death anniversary is just more than a month away. I would never forget his smile. A couple of times I dreamt about him. In both dreams, he was smilimg at me but never talking. It was as if he was telling me he was fine.\n\nI never ignored the signs again. I was always on guard. Vigilant. Even though to students I was never close with. He left a gaping hole in my heart. What more to his mother who did nothing but cry after that?\n\nI still think about him often.', ""I've only experienced this indirectly, but I'll share for what it's worth:\nMy friend's 14yo son took his own life. The family lived in a small country town, where I was working at the local primary school. I had previously taught his younger brother at a different school in the larger town nearby (before shifting to the local school where the boys had previously attended). I got the call (worst phone call I'd ever taken) about 8am and ran out of my classroom in a panic to go and be with my friend. On my way I saw my principal, who had taught the boy several years ago, and blurted it all out. On reflection it was an awful way to break the news to her, but I wasn't thinking clearly. I told her I had to go but would be back as soon as I could. She told me to take my time. \n\nI went round to my friend's house (very close to the school) and did what little I could to comfort her until others from her support network arrived to be with her. It was terrible. I then went back to school. \n\nI found that in the 2 hours I'd been gone, my principal had immediately contacted the local high school (the boy didn't actually attend this school, but she felt they would need to know as, coming from a very small town, they were a tight-knit community). They had got their counseling team together and arranged to rally round all the kids from this little town, to make sure they heard the news as gently as possible before being confronted with it on social media. They had also sent a counselor across to my school, just to support me. \n\nIn the days and weeks that followed, they continued to provide support for students close to the boy. There's a fine line to walk when discussing these issues, as there can be a flow on effect which can potentially lead to more suicides / self harm etc. I am very thankful for the counseling team who went above and beyond to support those kids and the wider community. They even put on an event in our small town inviting kids (and adults) from the boy's sporting team, to offer them support and counseling too."", ""This happened in a graduate class I was teaching in the UK. It is a very prestigious and quite difficult to get in, stay in, and graduate from. It wasn't as competitive as some other Universities and degree program. For the late 80's / early 90's, the school really had their ducks in a row. There were added hours for counseling… religious, non-religious... you name it, they had it. It's been a while, but I think they offered students that were friends or in the same class a 'no questions asked' medical leave. My PhD, at that point, had been completed and accepted. All that I had to do was complete the argument phase.\n\nI had to have at least one counseling session if I remember correctly.\n\nIt was pretty difficult. The class was *maybe* six students, so they kept a careful eye on everyone in the class and other classes. They did do an investigation (it might have been the police actually) and it was unfortunate, but no one thing went wrong. It was as if everything that held him together became untied at once."", 'He came from a Mormon family and seemed to have depression. There really was little I could do.', 'Thankfully my classroom experiences were all in an elementary school, so this issue didn’t come up.\n\nHowever, I work in a mental health program now, and we’ve had three former clients take their lives in less than a year.  Two of them were the kind of people that you love/hate to see discharge from treatment, because they worked so hard while in the program, and also brought a lot of inspiration and cohesion to the community while they were here.\n\nUnlike teaching, you’re warned before starting this kind of work that there is a slightly higher likelihood of that someone you serve may take their lives.  But you never get used to it; it runs through your mind every time you knock on a client’s door and they don’t answer.

183,Can someone explain African modern day slavery? Where the exports are going? Are the majority in forced labor?,"['slavery', 'african']",x0lokn,3,"['Modern day slavery is performed via captive labour and it comes in three shades:\n\n1. **Resource curse** \\- the resource curse is a term used to describe countries that are rich in natural resources but have weak (or non-existant) democratic institutions, allowing countries to take advantage of their natural wealth to fund social programs and deliver high quality of life for their citizens. The lack of these pillars of social order, permits corporations to take advantage, working with whatever authority figure they can buy (a warlord, a corrupt institution etc.) in order to extract the most resource for the lowest possible price. This technique usually turns the local population into barely regarded slave labour, because a diamond mine can run with diying slaves and still produce the wealth the extractors want.\n2. **Captive imported workers** \\- this type of slave labour is most popular in rich developed countries (the gulf countries, EU member states, US etc.). The scheme is usually similiar to human trafficing, where people from poorer countries are coerced or attracted with promises of higher income to move to another country. Upon their arrival, their passports and other documents are usually confistacted and they\'re forced to work usually for less than they were promised with the promise that they might get their documents and by scaring them into submission as they\'re usually smuggled into the country (semi)illegally.\n3. **Wage slavery** \\-  this is mostly an approach used for domestic labour in developed or developing countries. The technique requires the workers be employed and paid an amount that does not allow them to 1) feel confident enough to report labour rights abuses and 2) have the expendible income, required to freely look for another job. Wage slavery is most popular in areas where few businesses exist and the populce has little to no choice, so they ""need"" the job.', ""It's not just African, either - look up what happens to South Asians (ie, India, SL, Pakistan) in the wealthiest Gulf countries."", 'Just watch a youtube documentary about the congolese copper mines.']",https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/x0lokn/can_someone_explain_african_modern_day_slavery/

Every unprotected dog is vulnerable no matter where you live (city apartment or country home). It takes at least six months to test positive for heartworm after actually becoming becoming infected. During that time, the heartworm microfilaria wreak havoc on your dog's vasculature. Year-round prevention is an absolute must because mosquitos, which carry heartworm, exist year-round.\n\nThe treatment for heartworm disease includes a series of carefully timed intramuscular injections of an arsenic-based medication. The injection is given with a 1-1/2 inch needle in the muscle located in the lumbar region of your dog's back. The injection itself is very painful. The heartworm treatment kills the microfilaria in the blood stream. Once dead, where can they go? It's a closed system, so the little carcuses are floating around until they eventually break down. Throughout the course of treatment, your dog has to live a calm, sedentary life because exertion can literally kill your dog. When your dog's heart rate rises, blood pumps faster, and the deceased microfilaria can form an embolus.\n\nPrice of heartworm prevention: $70-150 (or more if it is a multimodal prevention, i.e. flea/tick/heartworm combo)\n\nPrice of heartworm treatment: $1100-1700. It is also not guaranteed to work.\n\nBuying heartworm prevention directly from your veterinarian is beneficial in a few ways: 1) the product comes directly from the manufacturer, so there is no question of its authenticity (there are incidents of fraudulent drugs/prevention being peddled to consumers); 2) manufacturers guarantee their products' efficacy, and product failure can result in reimbursement by the manufacturer, and 3) you get the medication right away.

And like many things we learn as children we don\'t often investigate them and simply assume them to be true or at least a truism, such is my case.  Oddly enough I am a Native American who deals with etymology professionally so the accuracy of this story is important to me on a few levels and yet I never looked at it skeptically.  Thanks to some feedback in this thread I have revisited (or just visited for the first time I guess) this with a skeptic\'s view (instead of a child\'s embrace of a romantic tale) and have subsequently arrived at the conclusion that this story is most likely not how Indians in America got their demonym.  This appears to have been floated in the late seventies and has taken root with writers like Russel Means, Nokus Tustanaki and others, then perpetuated from there.  Understandably a better story than some lost Italian guy getting the name of the place wrong, but here we are.  And while there is evidence to refute it, there isn\'t evidence to support it and that\'s what matters in etymology.  The earliest written citation of this as the source of the term is dated 1981 as best as I can find.  And more importantly the actual phrase is something I can not find in the original Columbus manuscripts.  Still looking, and a lot of his writing is lost but as of today, there\'s nothing I can find in his writings to support this phrasing from his hand.  His very first letter about the first voyage was published in Italy (in Latin) and in Spain (in Spanish) wherein the natives are alternatively referred to as Indians or Natives depending on the version published, so even if Columbus himself didn\'t call them ""Indians"" day one, they were called ""Indians"" by someone day one, and not in Dios or some other variation on that term and certainly not in a time frame that would support the pronunciation drift as the story goes.  Add to that the pattern of applying ""Indian"" to the wrong peoples has happened in the Philippines, Australia and other places so it\'s not like we can\'t see a pattern here.  So I hereby issue a formal apology to the fine people of Reddit and do also label this story a false etymology.

I was having trouble sleeping so I went out to my front porch and decided to listen to the rain. It was pouring really hard.\n\nRight as I was about to light up a cigarette, from the sidewalk  20 feet away i hear ""Uhhh, could I get one of those."" To my utter shock there was this women walking down the sidewalk in the pouring rain. She had to have been in her early 20\'s and was absolutely stunning. She was wearing a skin tight black dress that barely came down to her thigh. She was shivering so much she could barely walk.\n\nI invited her on to my portch gave her a cigarette. I asked her if she was okay and said if she needed help I could call someone the cops, family whoever she needed. She began to cry. I went and got a towel for her to dry off with. I had asked her if she wanted to come in and get dry, but either at that moment she was to ashamed or to afraid of me. I didn\'t  want to scare her so I just tried to talk to her.\n\nAt first she didn\'t say much still crying. After about 15 minutes it was like she had to get it out and say something. She had gone to a party with friends and had a crush on a guy that was throwing the party. Her friends had all knew this but when they got there, her friends had pulled a 180 and had all took turns hitting on this guy. Evidently one of them hooked up with the guy. She just left the party and walked out. She lived in the next town over and was going to walk there when it started to rain.\n\nAfter about an hour of talking with her she decided I was an ok person and asked if she could come in and use the restroom. I nodded and we walked into my house and showed her where it was. While she was in there I decide to go get a t-shirt and a pair of sweatpants so she had something dry to ware. She took them from me and got dressed. Now I\'m a big guy 6\'1"", 225 lbs. This woman in my bathroom had to have been a little over 5 foot maybe 100 lbs. I knew this was still a scary situation for her.\n\nAfter she had changed she came out sat on my couch. I couldn\'t help but laugh because she was swimming in my clothes. This made her laugh also, which lightened her mood. \n\nI asked her what she wanted to do. Offering to drive her home or saying she could stay here till she could get someone to come and get her. We sat in silence for a minute she was thinking about her choices. She finally looked at me and asked if she could sleep here on my coutch and leave in the morning. She didn\'t want to deal with her so called friends or her family tonight. I said sure so I went upstairs and got her a pillow and a blanket. After all this I showed her the kitchen and told her I was going to sleep.\n\n I went to bed exhausted knowing I had to pick my kids up the next day. \n\nThe next thing I know I see light from the night light I keep in the hallway as my bedroom door opens. At first I think maybe she is just freaked out about being in a strange house  but she just climbs into bed with me asking ""Is this is ok?"" , I think my response was ""uhh sure..."".\n\nShe curls up next to me wanting to be the small spoon. This is something I\'m not proud of but like most men. When you have a pair of hot female butt cheeks right next to your crotch you get a reaction. I was hard instantly. She noticed and immediately started grinding on me. She turned, pushed me on my back took off her cloths and she pulled my boxers off. I told her she didn\'t have to do this but she grabbed me and put me inside her and start riding. I had the best sex of my entire life that night and we fell asleep together.\n\nI woke up to an empty bed and a note in my kitchen. It said thank you for being a good man. I haven\'t seen her since, but I hope she is ok. I hope she is doing well in life. She changed my life for the better.
