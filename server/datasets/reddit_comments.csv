now if someone asks to see the manager u can say ‚Äúi AM da manager üòà‚Äù"
1,"Congratulations, fellow retail-adjacent manager!  Working a management job in a service/retail setting is so much more difficult and stressful than society as a whole gives us credit for.  So much socializing and inter-personal stuff.  I bet you're much better at it than you might initially think you are.  I'm a manager at a clothing store.

Career change does take a lot of time.  I've been working to get away from retail for years.  Bit by bit, be patient!  I almost drove myself nuts by expecting results too quickly.  Sounds like you have a path figured out and are walking it, that's the hard part!  

I don't know you, but I'm happy for you!"
2,Congratulations! When your webcomic is out be sure and link it here.
3,"As a fellow MCDS crew member, I say congrats. MCDS is a machine. I love working for them and hope to advance. You‚Äôll do well"
4,"Congrats! Having a plan is already more than most people, keep it up and you'll make it :)"
5,That‚Äôs incredible! Congratulations! I‚Äôm so proud of you ‚ù§Ô∏è
6,Keep it up!! Thats fantastic!!!!
7,You have every reason to be proud of yourself. Good job.
8,"Huge congratulations, you are doing amazing! It doesn‚Äôt matter how slow you‚Äôre moving towards your goals, the important part is that you‚Äôre moving towards them. Good luck, you sound like you know what you want and are going to make it happen."
9,"It feels fantastic being recognized for your effort doesn't it? I was promoted to a managerial position a few years ago, and I remember leaving work after my manager told me that  I got the position with the biggest smile on my face. 

Congrats. You've earned it. Hold on to that feeling. 

It took me a long time to get my first job, it took me a long time to get a promotion, it took me a long time get a girlfriend, so I know what it's like feeling like a failure. Don't let anyone else hold you down. You've achieved something, and that means something to you even if you're dad gets you down."
10,Congrats!! Getting a promotion is a clear indication of doing a good job and earning the trust of your company. And proof that you can work hard and achieve things you want to achieve.
11,"Congrats, awesome effin ' job! ! I worked at McD when I was younger, and for way longer than most people of my age, but frankly some of my most memorable relationships and life lessons came from working there (I thought I was great at it, but no one ever offered me a promotion, so good for you!!!) Your dad will catch on at some point and realize how amazing this is for you, but for now, don't waste time trying to convince him, just keep doing your thing and your success will be obvious to him at some point."
12,"Congrats on your promotion!

Moving up within any place is a great achievement. Your parents should be able to see that, whether they agree with your art or not. The fact that you're trying to build a website on top of that is incredible.

Keep using one endeavor to motivate the other, and chase your own definition of success."
13,"It‚Äôs refreshing to read about a success on here. I‚Äôm glad you are seeing success in life. Continue on and be sure to work on that web comic every chance you get.

I wish I can get it across to my father about what I want to do with my life. It can be really hard at times hearing what he has to say because it comes across as disappointment. Seems like he lost all pride in me after I left my crummy retail job.

Anything one can do to work for themselves is a step in the right direction. I can‚Äôt stand putting in all my effort somewhere only to be jerked around about my performance or exploited in some way."
14,Congratulations! Nice work.
15,Congrats! Success breeds success.
16,"Goddamn, this is depressing."
17,Don‚Äôt let other people‚Äôs opinions hold you back in life. You do what‚Äôs best for you. Congratulations
18,Yooooooo managers of reddit unite.
19,"Mazel tov! That‚Äôs wonderful! McDonald‚Äôs is a solid job, with endless upward promotion possibilities! You‚Äôre gonna do great! Make sure you take FULL advantage of all the offerings. Health insurance, dental, etc. Start your 401k if you haven‚Äôt already, and they match your cash up to a point. That‚Äôs FREE money! Max that out every year! If they match up to 10%, put in 10%. Compound interest is your friend. They also pay for education, so look into that if you want to take classes. I‚Äôm so proud of you!"
20,Best if you lose hope in making your parents proud and just live for you. Rip the bandaid off
21,"Good for you mate!


Love to see some good news on here, hopefully your dad'll come around when he see how well you're doing as manager."
22,"Congratulations, all the best for your new role! :)"
23,Congratulations!
24,So many congratulations to you!  You sound like you have motivation to keep rising and that‚Äôs amazing!
25,Congratulations
