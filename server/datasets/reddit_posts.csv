I do my job properly, I do everything I‚Äôm supposed to and more, I‚Äôm at the office 8,5 hours a day or at home office.. everything I need to do is done on time, but they‚Äôre saying I don‚Äôt show enough initiative. I‚Äôve had the same problem with the past three jobs now.

I asked them what does that mean and I was told ‚Äújust what we said‚Äù, I asked to explain and they said ‚Äúyou just seem like you‚Äôre not happy to be here and don‚Äôt want this job‚Äù.
I socialise, as much as I know how to and it‚Äôs actually quite a lot, cause I mask pretty well and it‚Äôs not evident that I‚Äôm autistic, I actually don‚Äôt need to ask too many questions cuz I understand stuff quickly. 

The only thing I see that I could be doing wrong is, I don‚Äôt eat lunch with them cause I bring my own food and don‚Äôt socialise a lot cause that‚Äôs not in my nature. So.. the fact that I don‚Äôt gossip and spend endless hours in the lounge means I‚Äôm not showing enough initiative?

I‚Äôm so done working with NT‚Äôs. I thought I didn‚Äôt know what I want and need. Turns out they don‚Äôt. My gf says I should try to befriend people and socialise more, but I came here to work, not to make new friends.

Stuff I've seen other, more ""normal"" people do. 

But it always seems that my friendships peter out and that people eventually decide that I am not worth knowing. I go from lots of shallow friendships to nobody at all in my life. This has happened a depressing number of times.

 I think it has something to do with misreading social cues.

7,Today I learned my greatest insecurity is my attitude.,"['attitude', 'insecurity', 'learned', 'today', 'greatest']","Growing up undiagnosed, I was always in trouble for having an attitude. I was confused. I never felt like I had an attitude problem; everyone else seemed to think so. Even before I knew about autism, I learned that I should change the way that I treat people. Even when I was sure I was being respectful, I was told... otherwise. Fast forward to the current day - I'm finally diagnosed, have my own place, a good job, a steady partner. I still have the same problem with my attitude. I will add - my job is one that hires people on the spectrum and who identify as disabled - a dream job. There, they understand I mean well, have no ""attitude."" Generally, my partner, family, and friends know this too. However, there are occasional misunderstandings... mostly minor, some major. Today, I had a major misunderstanding. My partner and I got into a stupid fight. He wanted to have dinner at my house tonight. For some reason, he thought I was ok with that even though he didn't ask. When someone believes you're ok with something without asking, that's called assumption. I learned that early in life. When you take assumption too far, that's crossing boundaries. I learned about boundaries and assertiveness later in life. These are things I learned from tumultuous personal experience. Now, I look for the signs. I know better. I speak up. Since I felt that a line was being crossed, I said no. The thing is, sometimes people don't like the way you say no. That's what happened with my partner and I today. We were talking on the phone... I spoke more loudly than usual... because he was at the rapids. He thought I yelled at him. Then he hung up on me. I had no idea what happened. So he came by to pick up his stuff. That's when he told me I was being rude. He hung up on me because I yelled etc. I said I was mad because of the assumption, but not yelling. I wanted us to come to a mutual understanding, but he just wanted to leave, so he left. My understanding is when I tried to assert myself today, I was met with opposition. I'm really upset because he won't talk to me. I've lost people to this stuff. I'm just scared. I feel like I did something really wrong here. That being said, I love him, and I never meant to fight. I was only trying to show him that he crossed a line. I know people don't like how I say it, but the message is still true. It's my truth. Anyways... I don't know if I'll ever learn how to tell when someone feels that I'm being rude. I just know it sure didn't feel good for my partner to hang up on me today and I hope he comes around soon.",ws33yd,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/ws33yd/today_i_learned_my_greatest_insecurity_is_my/

11,My son (3.5) got his official diagnosis today so I wrote him a letter (email),"['diagnosis', 'letter', 'email', 'wrote', 'son']","Hi Baby,

Today we took you to the doctor and she did an evaluation where she officially diagnosed you with Autism. She was blown away at how intelligent and amazing you are, and I have to say that we agree (of course). 

I'm both exhaling and spinning because although we knew you were special for quite some time, I don't think we expected anything to ever be diagnosed. But here we are. We are ready to see where this journey of life takes us. I know things may be harder for you but we have known for a very long time (since you were a baby and wouldn't sleep without Dad dancing you up and down in his arms) that you were one of a kind.

I promise to always do my very best for you. Since I found out you were in my belly I wanted a child who was wild and free. A child who looked at nature with wonder and was happiest just listening to music. And look who found me. As a parent, it's really, really, hard to feel like you're making the right decision for your children. A diagnosis doesn't change my love for you; but it does light an extra fire in me to make sure that you're getting what you deserve out of this wonderful life. 

There will be challenges, but I want you to know that you're never, ever, alone even though sometimes it will feel that way. I'm here for you, forever. To listen, even though I may not fully understand. To learn with you along the way, and to hug you when you need it and to let go when you say stop (even though it's so hard because you're the cutest human being on the planet). 

I love you M. You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the ocean in a drop.

Initially I was diagnosed with depressive disorder. About 15 years later I was diagnosed as having AADD and mild OCD. 
So I‚Äôm wondering why it took so long for a psychiatrist to eventually suggest that I could have autism, Asperger‚Äôs. And that was after a couple comments from a friend who is the same and he suspected that I might be and I did a couple self tests and discussed it with a psychiatrist‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs no answer as to why because I think they were all competent to appoint therapist and psychiatrist but it just is really frustrating. It would‚Äôve helped a lot if I‚Äôd known this 10,20 or even 30 years ago. I think I would‚Äôve been more kind to myself and it would have answered some questions

 About 20 years ago I was wondering if I was a sex addict. However after tending several 12 step meetings for that, doing some appropriate reading on the topic I realized I did not even come close to the ‚Äúdefinition‚Äù.
I realized that what I was seeking was affection and some type of intimacy. I‚Äôve learned that some of us lack, yet crave, Physical and emotional intimacy with others and some seem to have a need for affection that is hard to fill.

I realize that I was doing this through inappropriate dating and through random sexual encounters.

15,I (Autistic female) do not like my autistic nephew,"['autistic', 'nephew', 'female', 'like']","Text summarizes it, but I am a female (38) and my little sister has a kid about 3. He is non verbal. He throws his poop at you daily. He doesn‚Äôt speak and is very physically violent. 

I am saying this as someone who doesn‚Äôt go near him at all but am daily pressed to answer questions about his behavior.

Yes I‚Äôm an autistic female but I‚Äôm HFA and this is a whole new universe. Also just his daily movements, disruptions, noises, very much upset me.

I honestly want nothing to do with my so called like-minded nephew. His own issues seem to trigger mine.

16,Should I talk to my doctor about looking into getting tested?,"['doctor', 'tested', 'looking', 'talk', 'getting']","For context, I‚Äôm a minor and my parents would have to know if I was tested (idk if you can avoid it but they would know anyway, bc that‚Äôs the way they are; I can‚Äôt go places without them knowing). I don‚Äôt think they would be the most receptive to me getting tested for anything, especially my dad since he refuses to believe that he probably has anxiety and why should his position change when it comes to me? I have my yearly appointment in a little over 9 hours and I don‚Äôt know if I should talk to my doctor about this. 

Originally I was planning to talk to her about depression and anxiety, since I was pretty sure my mental health was as simple as that. However, I recently began wondering if I have high functioning (I‚Äôm sorry if you don‚Äôt like the term but it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôve seen used most) autism.

I tend to like routines but only if I make them myself, and I hate it when someone forgets to tell me about an event and I have a day or less to know (even if I don‚Äôt have to prepare, I just hate suddenly having it pop up).
I can‚Äôt eat certain textures of foods, especially grilled food. If there‚Äôs any char (yk like the black stuff), I gag on it.
I have gone nonverbal multiple times, usually after a period of stress. I assumed that this was because I always tie up my emotions while stressed and then when it‚Äôs over everything‚Äôs just a lot and not anything at the same time (that may not make sense sorry).
I have always hated not having some sort of repetitive movement, even if it has to be as small as running my finger across my lips. 
I am horrible with new people and not great with social situations in general, especially because I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôm allowed to talk (like will they get mad or smth idk I don‚Äôt always think rationally in that situation). 
There are some smaller ones but that‚Äôs most of it and I‚Äôm going to post this now because I don‚Äôt have much time until my appointment.

I also have reasons for mentioning depression and anxiety and I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point. Any ideas?",ws46np,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/ws46np/should_i_talk_to_my_doctor_about_looking_into/

22,Should I consider getting an assessment for autism?,"['autism', 'assessment', 'consider', 'getting']","Hello!

I am writing here today because I have been really conflicted on whether or not to pursue a diagnosis for autism. Just to clarify, I‚Äôm not looking for a diagnosis, just people who deal with this and their opinion on these traits I have that make me think I may have it. In the past few months, I really started learning what autism can look like through media and that prompted me to do my own research, not with the thought I may have it. After doing the research though, I found I related to a good amount of traits that were described. I am currently diagnosed with bipolar II w/out psychosis and ADHD along with general anxiety. I am on a mood stabilizer, and it seems to help prevent depression from coming back but I still have the physical effects of the depression such as poor self care, poor eating, and isolation. The fact that the mood stabilizer kinda helped the depression makes me think that I really do have bipolar II and not autism but also the fact that I relate so much to so many people, stories, and articles makes me think otherwise. I also have a good amount of childhood trauma from an alcoholic father so I also wonder if that could be the cause of my issues. Heres a list I‚Äôve compiled over the last couple of months of traits I notice in myself/myself as a child. Based on this list, does anyone think I should pursue a diagnosis? I want to know the best way to help myself, to know if these meds I‚Äôm on are the way to go or to know if I‚Äôve been misdiagnosed bipolar or ADHD. I know you won‚Äôt have these exact answers, they‚Äôre just answers I hope to find along my journey through this. Thank you in advance!

Autistics have too many cortical neurons which *can* lead theoretically with slower processing or can lead to high intelligence. 

I almost certainly think it leads to synaptic overload. And the formation of too many neural connections. I think this explains our sensory overload response to stimulus. 

I think this also explains why the genes associated with autism are associated with high intelligence and why there are many autists with extremely high IQs at much larger proportions than NT populations.

Editing to add: 

IQ is just one data point but not the only one. Lots of autistic people that would struggle to sit through a standard IQ test often have exceptional and skewed abilities and/or different ways or patterns of looking at the world that is remarkable. 

The point about IQ is because even though ASD is called a disability, a large proportion of us skew toward high IQ - an NT measure for fitness and intelligence. It fascinates me though it is not the most important or relevant thing.

I think it‚Äôs important to understand how our increase in cortical neurons relates back to all of this. And it helps shed light on the spectrum of both ability/potential and disability in the autistic community.",wqu2me,404,163,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wqu2me/autism_a_disorder_of_high_intelligence_linked/

36,Why I enjoy the faces of animals,"['faces', 'animals', 'enjoy']","Just had a thought about why I like animal faces

Since the thought just occured to me I don't have it super thought out, but the feeling of the thought is still there and feels very real.

I'll explain in bullet form.

* If I look at something for too long I get ""bored of it"" for lack of better term. It starts exhausting me.
* We live in a society**‚Ñ¢**, we se peoples faces every day. This participates in draining me.
   * (It's alraedy bad enough with the autism-eye contact thing.)
* I'm not very expressive, physically or verbally. So my enjoyment of faces can't come from others being expressive in casual ways.
   * (This is something to do with empathy. Using ones own abilities and experiences as framework. See wikipedia 'empathy'.)
* So I can't enjoy faces due to their expressions unless it's similar to when I am expressive, which are extreme expressions such as overhwhelming joy / bouts of heavy laughter, etc.
* **!!!NOW TO THE POINT!!!**: Animals have flat faces, but I can appreciate animal faces for the wide range of animal faces (see 1st bullet).
   * Animal faces can be ""extreme"" (see bullet 4)
   * At one point look at otter videos, I'm appreciating the otter face.
   * Then I'm bored of otter faces. Next animal face that I appreciate happens to be camel. It looks like they're smiling, like leopard geckos! That's great.

I was just wondering if anyone else is super sensitive to social cues and linguistic patterns in other people. Maybe I'm not objectively good at applying abstractions in social situations and being able to instantly read people.  But once I aggregate enough data, it's almost like I read people way too well and even start to know parts of them better than they know their selves. 

I will say I'm not oblivious to social cues, tones of voice, sarcasm, empathy. I have all of those intact and perhaps on overdrive. I am getting all this input I feel like i very much struggle with OUTPUT in relation to my autism. Like i cannot really operate properly within said circumstances. I end up building up sooo much data. It's gotten better over the years in terms of allocating less of my mind space to other people and more of it to myself... But when it comes to my romantic relationship, it's on the max and i while I'm in a very healthy relationship with the one of the most amazing people I've ever met, I'm absolutely terrified that if it hasn't already started, it will begin to drive a wedge between us. 

I don't want to be too picky but I'm just so sensitive and observe way too much from every situation just constantly thinking about and hyperanalyzing anything that's ""off rhythm "" or out of pattern and then like abstracting out patterns from those moments that are built up in my memories by comparing and contrasting the idiosyncracies of the moments.

He sympathized with my neurodivergence.,"['harrassment', 'officer', 'talk', 'neurodivergence', 'police']","So, long story short, this girl who thought we had a future together decides to ditch me in the middle of our sixth date and after trying to calmly have a talk in order to end things and find out what I could improve on in the future or with myself, she merely tells me she had a bad gut feeling and trusts it and then just ghosts me. I get anxious and impulsive and then send her texts where I calmly try to see if she will elaborate, and I try to save my reputation by affirming that I am in no way a threat. 

This makes me really sad and self-conscious. I tell her that I am on the spectrum, but I still get nothing. I know I should have left her alone but I am really bad at taking nonverbal cues as absolute. I was hoping that she would just tell me something so I could shut up and go away. But society treats this as ‚Äúgiving in to a manipulator‚Äù. I have my flaws, but I had no intention of manipulating and doing harm. 

After this passed, I felt so ashamed for reacting how I did and confirming her gut feeling about me (whatever that may be), so I thought I should try to salvage my bad deeds by apologizing a few weeks later. I never once pressured her to respond back. I just wanted to redeem myself and say ‚ÄúI messed up, just know that I‚Äôm not who you think I am‚Äù Still no response. This time she reports me to law enforcement.

An officer calls me and explains that I am not in trouble, but if I contact her again, I will violate the law. I understood and got really sad. He asked for my side of the story and I told him about how I am not good with these situations, how I am on the spectrum, and I never meant to be creepy. He understood and somewhat sympathized with me. He even told me that what she did on our date was not a nice thing and that this girl might not be as nice of a person as I think she is. He told her that what I did was not a crime. It sounded like she wanted to get me in trouble really badly. 

Now, I am not trying to use ASD as a justification for electronic harrassment. But, it seems like some neurotypical people are very ableist and think we are crazy psycopaths who will do harm. This hurts my feelings since I am a very timid person and would never commit a crime. Sometimes I struggle with understanding someone‚Äôs boundaries. This is why good communication needs to be taught more in autism awareness. I now feel really ashamed. I almost committed a crime when all I wanted was to save face, but I also felt so bad for freaking out this girl and just wanted to say sorry for being a weirdo. She made me feel like a creep from the start and I inadvertently acted like one. Lesson learned. I will ghost back when ghosted from now on. Thoughts? How can I rub off the feeling that I am a creep/stalker?",wqh7q3,186,110,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wqh7q3/had_a_talk_with_a_police_officer_after_my_ex/

64,Is being very mildly autistic a recipe for lifelong suffering?,"['autistic', 'suffering', 'mildly', 'lifelong', 'recipe']","Cos it sure feels like it to me. 

Having mild Aspergers (mild even within the range of Aspergers) seems to put you in a kind of social no man's land. You're ""normal"" enough so that you appear like everyone else on the surface but ""autistic enough"" so prevent really being able to integrate socially. ""Normal enough"" to understand what is expected of you, but ""autistic enough"" to never be able to reach that standard. 

Most people you meet will treat you very slightly differently, in ways that seem innocuous but which over time add up to massively change the direction of your life for the worse. You'll be ignored,  mocked, overruled and rejected for things without any obvious explanation. You'll seem to have a very limited ability to make friends or have control over your social life. Sometimes it can be so subtle that you wonder if you're imagining it or if the same thing happens to everyone else. (These examples are from my life as you may have guessed.)

You would think that being ""mildly autistic"" would mean that the impact on your life is mild, especially compared to more obvious forms of Aspergers. But in my experience nothing could be further from the truth. It seems that being in just the right range of Aspergers will condemn you to a life of misery, loneliness, depression, confusion and frustration that would be avoided if you were not autistic at all OR more obviously autistic. 

I could be wrong about this of course. Maybe I'm attributing to Aspergers other stuff that is treatable, like depression. Maybe the social skills I require can be learned and I just need to try harder. But right now I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle with my own brain. I'm 28, turning 29 and despite years of masking and trying to figure people out and improve my social skills, it's like Im stuck in this purgatory that I can never escape from. I'm at a particularly low ebb at the moment, hence the depressing rant.

Anyway I just wanted to get that off my chest. Any thoughts are welcome.",wq4gt7,892,264,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wq4gt7/is_being_very_mildly_autistic_a_recipe_for/

Ironically he seemed to me he had a classic ADHD symptoms + ODD which are together a psychopathy predictor according to researchers.

For the first time ever I told my mum about my issues - specifically the ones with people at school (if you can be arsed to slog through my posts you‚Äôll see other shit she‚Äôs done before)
So she‚Äôs well aware of it and how it‚Äôs affecting me

Yesterday my dad, who I‚Äôve never had a good relationship with, started yelling and swearing at me and told me to get out of the house all because I didn‚Äôt answer his question about locking a door in 2 seconds- not an exaggeration- because I wasn‚Äôt sure if I had the key or he did and my hands were full so I was trying to remember, so i haven‚Äôt been speaking to him much if at all, cos im sick of his shit, 

This morning my mum came in and started shouting at me for not wanting to go help my dad at work, like why tf would I? And gave typical manipulative tactics like blackmail etc., she also sent my grandma up to try and get me to feel guilty too

Like a half hour ago my dad came in to my room causing problems again over a light I left on downstairs - there‚Äôs a switch for said light next to the door to his room- so he‚Äôs taken longer coming to me than if he had just turned it off

My mum started shouting at me too, and said she‚Äôs pissed at me because of the way I speak to people (because despite my 7th year of diagnosis she can‚Äôt wrap her head around the fact that my tone isn‚Äôt indicative of anything) and said that‚Äôs the reason I don‚Äôt have any friends, it‚Äôs not and she knows it, it‚Äôs not the first time she‚Äôs been purposefully manipulative or spiteful: in the past she‚Äôs brought up close, recently passed relatives in arguments against me, she has threatened me with suicide, etc. And im fairly sure this is something else that‚Äôs on her, just trying to check

68,Feelings of Emptiness,"['emptiness', 'feelings']","I didn't sleep so sorry if I seem a bit unclear sometimes.

I'm slowly losing interest in all the things I like. Playing video games is now mainly something I do for the sake of doing something, or to have something to talk about, rather than for enjoyment. I don't get the satisfaction out of solving the Rubik's cube anymore. Learning about Linux and experimenting with it just isn't fun anymore. I keep playing the drums just because I have most of my life. I still like these activities, but I don't really have any real motivation to do them, and just do them for the sense of normality and consistency.

I struggle to perceive time sometimes because my days blend together. Most of my days are the same. If reminded of something, I sometimes can't tell if it happened yesterday or weeks ago.

I wake up, brush my teeth and go to college if it's a weekday. I put in the bare minimum amount of effort, if any, into my work knowing that it will come back to bite me later. But I just can't care enough to do anything more. I used to care more about my future but now I just deal with things as they come.

I talk to my friends about things we have in common. Though I may joke around and appear to have fun with them, I'm usually thinking of something else, or nothing at all. We may have things in common, but I don't feel like I have a true emotional connection with them. If they stopped talking to me I'd probably be sad for a few days then I'm back to neutral again. I don't particularly like thinking this way, because I care lot about them, but I think it regardless. In the unlikely scenario any of my friends are reading this, please don't take that too personally.

After all this I go home and cook the same meal I eat every day and go to my room to do something that will keep me occupied until it's time to eat or sleep. Sometimes I just sit or lay down and do nothing.

I then go to bed and sometimes I'll sleep the full night, but most of the time I don't. I'll usually lay there awake or keep waking up during the night for no reason. It used to frustrate me but I'm just worn out at this point. Then I get up in the morning and do it all again.

The only one who I'd say I shared a deep bond and emotional connection with was my dog who we got when he was a baby and we basically grew up together. Whenever I felt down, I would go and lay with him, and sometimes he'd come to me and he would lay with me. I'd stroke him and if I stopped he'd put his paw on my arm so I would start again, or he'd climb and lay on me and we'd stay there a bit longer. It was really comforting and probably my favourite moments of my life. He died in February.

I recently went to watch a show in a theatre as part of a school trip alongside my friends. What was meant to be a fun occasion served as a grim reminder more than anything. Looking around, everyone else was laughing at the jokes and having fun and enjoying the songs, but I was not. I didn't find it interesting at all, and the loud music and bright lights hurt my head and caused me struggle to think properly. I bit my fingers throughout most of it, trying to to anchor my thoughts, and to distract me from everything going on. I didn't even know I had sensory issues that bad, so it was a learning experience for me. I've since bought a pair of earplugs I take everywhere with me for if I feel it is getting too loud.

Though I spend time with these people and consider them my friends, and whilst they might also think of me as their friend, I know that we will probably never truly understand eachother.

I'm usually quite closed off with regards to my thoughts and feelings. I don't talk about them with anyone, not even my family, and if anyone asked I'd probably lie. So I'm not really sure why I'm even writing this. Maybe it's a way to cope, maybe I'm looking for advice, or maybe someone who can relate to me. It's good to get things off your chest sometimes.

And I think, do these people not have any empathy?

I've read a book called ""How Emotions Are Made"" by Lisa Feldman Barrett. I want to share the ideas from it because it might help people like me.

Some parts of the classical understanding of emotions use the categorization of facial expressions and physical sensations. The problem is facial expressions depend on the context, the same expression of a person can be interpreted as *fear* or *excitement* if we change the environment they are in. Or you may mistake the feeling of *romantic attraction* with the physical sensation of *flu symptoms.* We can't pinpoint emotions with scientific measurement either, brain scans of love seem completely different for each individual. There isn't a single point where a certain emotion occurs, or there isn't a brain pattern of an emotion.

The theory of constructed emotion doesn't consider emotions as universally same experiences. Imagine the green color of the grass, everyone knows what green is supposed to look like, we've learnt what it is and experienced it countless times. But we don't know if the green I see is the same green you see, we might be perceiving different colors yet we both call it ""green"". The same concept can be applied to sound, you might be more sensitive to certain frequencies than others, and your experience of music can be different from somebody else. So, the theory is saying that you subconsciously create your own emotions according to your previous experiences, knowledge, perception, and interoception. You constantly process external information and come up with predictions, if your prediction is invalidated you update your internal model to come up with better predictions next time. This process differs for each person and it is quite different when you look at it cross-culturally. Rather than being wired with emotions from birth, you learn them over time.

To me, this is satisfying because I can explain my experience using it. I didn't embrace the culture, traditions, or religion around me. The way I process life is quite different probably due to ASD. Therefore it's understandable that my experience of emotions (or lack thereof) are different too.

Do you think it makes sense? If you manage to explain your own emotional process please share, I find this topic fascinating at the moment!",wquurj,2,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wquurj/theory_of_constructed_emotion/

93,Long winded lots of words in text and talking in real life. Anybody else?,"['talking', 'winded', 'text', 'words', 'long']","I have a lot to say and a LOT going on in my mind at any one time. Any given moment. I've had numerous people comment lately about how much I type or talk.  I used to penpal with people and I would always write a LOT because i had a lot to say. Lots of things i was thinking about and the point of a conversation is to share what you're thinking right?

I also ask questions and care about what the other person is thinking about or their opinions etc. So its not like I'm talking AT them or anything. I talk to them and generally have very enjoyable conversations with people. Always respectful and polite. But i talk and write a  lot.

But like reddit for example i still use on the computer. The majority of people are on their phone and people make comments about WOW that's a lot of text etc. Alot of people are so used to the phone thing that they think its always been this way where people talk in freakin emjojiis, slang terms and acronyms. They seem to think two words is an in depth conversation somehow. Im old enough to remember the internet when people had actual conversations.

I had some person last night on the spot within literal moments of meeting me diagnose me with ""mania"" because i actually write complete thoughts. Ill be honest i found it really annoying and about damn silly to decide from a couple paragraphs somebody is manic? Kinda pissed me off because i was already dealing with some other stuff and it didn't sit well with me at all. Mainly because of the stressful situation i was dealing with. But it genuinely  is really annoying for the most part. Just because I'm not like them and they cant seem to fathom talking in more than 1 or 2 sentences doesn't mean there's anything wrong with me. It JUST means I'm not like them.

&#x200B;

So I thought maybe i would ask here and see your thoughts. As you see this post is probably considered ""long"" by some.

I just wondered if anybody else here finds themselves very wordy and have a lot to say? I have a friend that has OCD and when we used to penpal i know she would write a lot also. I have a personality disorder not OCD but it falls into that same bracket as that and i just wonder if its something to do with the PD or this is an ASD thing or something else entirely? Or maybe theres not a damn thing wrong with me and these people are lazy lack imagination and don't have much to say themselves?

They're fleeting, I rarely feel anything strong, when I do I can't handle it well and half the time I have a very poor grasp on what I'm even feeling or why and I can only understand them from an intellectual perspective.

My ex boss who had been my boss for 5 years until he decided to go elsewhere left fairly recently and he was sort of a mentor to me and I got promoted pretty significantly under him. His son very recently tied and I just found out today.

I don't feel sad or empty currently and to be honest I can't make an empathetic connection there, it's not a situation I've been in and empathy is pretty come and go with me but similarish situations have popped up before and even if I do feel some emotion about it or empathy it usually takes a while for me to figure out(which I did mention in passing to someone close to him that might have been a mistake but it came out alright) so there's always a period of camouflaging which is a bit mentally unhealthy.

It triggers a sort of imposter syndrome emotion where I feel less than human(or just different in a fundamental way) or I internally get annoyed because I have to pretend to feel a way I'm not and act like someone I'm really not.

 This seems to form a bit of a loop/spiral because then I feel bad because I should feel bad from whatever the negative event was but I don't, instead I'm annoyed I have to change how I act which makes me feel further from human and that makes me feel worse again since I'm getting more caught up with myself than the issue at hand and that keeps repeating

It also feels dishonest to camouflage in these situations but it'd be far more impolite to not show a general concern and could really hurt someones feelings so I'm 95% it's the right thing to do and it definitely helps me survive/persist in groups where I can't be myself as much like pretty much any work environment

Is there a different way I should be looking at these situations that's more productive? Or a way to stop the cycle from gaining momentum?

97,Why is it that many parents of children with Asperger's have a personality disorder?,"['asperger', 'disorder', 'parents', 'children', 'personality']","I have noticed, as well as many others, that parents of autistic children often have a personality disorder like NPD. It could be that the genes that provide have these deficits are also related to autism. Incidentally this could have been what Leo Kanner observed with his refrigerator mother theory, although the deficit being transfered through genetics and not parenting. There is an issue with this. These kind of people are not understanding of our autism and mistreat us more easily. This is the grand tragedy.

What is your experience with this?

Edit;  I see many saying their family has PD, so I would also ask how do you get along with them? Having an autistic child to someone with NPD would be a big blow to their ego for example. Lets not let this turn into an excuse fest for autism leading to personality disorders though.

Edit 2: Lots of brutal responses, but a lot of them are off topic discussing misdiagnosis. I am mostly concerned with parents with actual personality disorders because they are more likely to abuse autistic children. Also if you believe that autism leads to personality disorder you probably have one and are looking to make excuses, but regardless you are on the fringe of psychology.

Whenever anyone is upset I do everything I can to comfort them, but no matter how much I help them I feel like an imposter because I just don‚Äôt feel that much for them. 

I envy people who are naturally very empathic because of how well they comfort others. The way they sound so genuine and soothe people effortlessly is so mesmerising to me. 

to not end on a bad note, I can at least take pride knowing that I give 110% effort into comforting an upset person no matter my lack of empathy. People have told me that I‚Äôve helped them feel better so it isn‚Äôt all bad.

a manipulator would use the history of somebody to commit an act and put that act on them , this act must conform with the history of the person so people would build an accusation based on their knowledge of that history .

I am interested in philosophy and religions. Reading religious texts and philosophical books I realized that often described ""sins"", ""cognitive distortions"", ""destructive tendencies"", ""vices"" are seem not to be  a struggle for autistic people quite the opposite they seem to have some so called ""virtues"". 

Of course it is probably because most literature is written by NT for NT and because of highly hostile environment for ND that forces them to develop certain characteristics. There are obviously religious and philosophical books that were written by autistics but we can only assume who was and wasn't on the spectrum. Also, no need to mention that everyone is different and people on the spectrum are not a walking stereotype, but still I am interested if you have noticed something like that.

So guys, please give me an example of highly condemned behavior or trait in such a book or moral system that you just don't have. For me it was lies and lust. The amount of attention dedicated to them for me was always odd.

I've found ways to cope, and strategies to help, but I was curious about others' experiences.

Thanks for sharing.

I just had my first relationship now at 27 and it only lasted 1 month but now I just had the worst discussion so far. My gf(ex) told me she was joining a hiit program of a 1h session and i immediately told her, don't go there, that can't be serious or is either a scam because hiit as a maximum only last 30mins and this on the most chilling scenario because normally it's only like 15 mins, we are suppose to burn all our reserves in a really short amount of time in order to really enjoy the benefits of hiit. You can't really achieve enough intensity If your training last as long as 1 hour, that means you are taking too many breaks, resting to much or not going as hard and you should....

Anyways, point is, she replied back that it really is a hiit and it last 1h, that a close friend of her recommended it. I remember her about what hiit really is, I send her links, I remember her that I also studied sports as a hobby when I practiced calisthenics and my cousin has a master's degree in sports sciences. Still she argued to me that I can't disrespect her friends opinion and that it is hiit because she been there and she knows.

I replied that I felt offended because I was giving real information with fundaments, evidence, and has strong support from experience. Not just an anecdotic opinion...

She said it's impossible to have a relationship with me because I always have something to say, a criticism, an argument. 

I told her that she needs to differentiate between evidence and anecdotic experience, because I'm talking about hiit from a science focus based on sports science.

142,My sister is convinced my daughter is Asperger‚Äôs,"['asperger', 'sister', 'daughter', 'convinced']","I‚Äôm really sorry if it‚Äôs not ok to post this here, the rules are a bit vague so I‚Äôm not sure, feel free to tell me if I‚Äôm out of line.

It‚Äôs been 2 years now since my sister first broached the idea that my (then 2) daughter is Asperger‚Äôs.

She listed a bunch of indicators that honestly, she seemed to have a very simplified understanding of, not that I‚Äôm an expert.

I listened though because she raised a child with Asperger‚Äôs so thought she might have noticed something an experienced mother might.

She thinks intelligence is a sign of Asperger‚Äôs. My understanding is that people with Asperger‚Äôs can often become subject matter experts because they can focus on matters of interest but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they have high intelligence.

My daughter is generally intelligent, her dad is a 1% and I‚Äôve always been very good at early education so it‚Äôs really no surprise that she‚Äôs broadly intelligent, but she‚Äôs not focussed on any subject in particular, she‚Äôs curious by nature and interested in everything. There doesn‚Äôt appear to be any indicators she‚Äôs a savant or anything, she‚Äôs just a bit ahead of her peers and understands things a bit easier.

My daughter doesn‚Äôt like making eye contact with my sister either. She‚Äôs a big lady and very loud and in your face. It‚Äôs pretty normal for kids in general to be avoidant if such large personalities, especially when their household doesnt use loud voices to communicate. It‚Äôs not noise sensitivity because she has no trouble turning the tv up loud, going to parties that are loud by nature, we even sat first row a meter away from a loud dirt bike show and inferred her headphones because it was VERY loud but she was fine and had no interest in the headphones.

In the wild, my daughter is not typically shy or reserved either, it‚Äôs only around my sister. In fact when I see kids her age enter new social situations they are normally hesitant where my daughter just kinda strolls in and starts engaging with confidence.

My sister also thinks that my daughter ‚Äòneeds‚Äô routine. The only routine she ever ‚Äòneeded‚Äô was the one we trained her to have, bedtime, when she was 2 we didn‚Äôt like to stay out late because we were training good sleep habits and daughter would get cranky by 7 pm because she was tired. This is normal for toddlers to need a lot of sleep and get cranky when they get tired, it‚Äôs not about routine at all, the routine was coming from us to support a healthy sleep pattern.

There‚Äôs a normal developmental stage at about 2 where kids will experiment with lining things up, which my daughter did for a brief period, but she was not fussed if her work got moved, which I believe is the indicator you look for, not the fact that they go through a short phase of doing it.

My sister has also made comments that irk me as well because they seem uninformed, like people with aspbergers can‚Äôt lie, I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs not actually true , it‚Äôs just they can be known for being blunt.

And that they can‚Äôt be violent in anyway, but I know someone who is diagnosed and known to punch and become abusive when they become overwhelmed and she says they can‚Äôt have it because violence and aggression isn‚Äôt possible with aspbergers.

There‚Äôs more but I think I‚Äôve made my point, I just don‚Äôt see anything that concerns me at this stage, she socialises well, meets all her milestones, doesn‚Äôt have meltdowns for any reason.

I also found out last year that her daughter was never diagnosed, she told everyone for 15 years her daughter is aspbergers but omitted that it was her opinion, not an evaluated diagnosis. So everyone believes she knows what she‚Äôs talking about and that she‚Äôs right to be stressed that I‚Äôm neglecting my kid for not treating her like she‚Äôs got aspbergers. She‚Äôs very stressed about it and telling family how concerned she is and now they are reaching out to me asking why I don‚Äôt get her assessed just in case. 

Because I have no concerns, if I do that  may as well get her assessed for every other thing she might have but isn‚Äôt showing signs of yet.

Besides, when they ask me it‚Äôs under the impression she‚Äôs speaking as an educated and experienced mum of a child with it. They don‚Äôt know she never had her child diagnosed. At this stage, I‚Äôm not even sure if she simply decided not to get her own kid support when she suspected it, if she did seek an assessment and was told kid doesn‚Äôt have it and she ignored the result, and why she told everyone kid has it as if it was a medical diagnosis, but she doesn‚Äôt appear to be a reputable source of knowledge to me and I wish she would back off and not start getting others involved to convince me (people who don‚Äôt even know my kid, just basing it off their respect for her as an experienced mother)

If my kid ever shows signs of struggling with anything, then I seek professional opinion, not make a guess then stick with it as though I know better than any expert.

FYI: we had a psychologist involved last year for my partner because he was freaking out as a first time dad and she helped him settle in. As part of the intake she screened for any obvious concerns. Nothing.
I asked her paediatrician if I should have concern and he said no.

I was going to have to heave myself into the big revolving glass door, and I was going to have to do it on a day when there were many extra people funneling in there with me at high speed. Shit. They made it look so easy. 

My anxiety started rising but I couldn't slow down now. I charged into The Vortex at full tilt. Like, literally leaning waaaay too far forward, so I had too much momentum going in. Oh, and I'm a ridiculously tall and bizarrely pale ghost of a white woman with a perpetual scowl, so I'm pretty sure I looked like some sort of terrifying huge pale diagonal of a big glowering beastie charging headlong into that spinning glass cage.

My momentum worked: I had managed to get my ass into The Vortex (yay), but now things were moving really fast. I gripped the bar on the wedge partition in front of me just as my brain noticed the soft little 'blip' sound as noise levels dropped around me (unexpected bonus!). I was beginning to understood that exiting this glass merry-go-round was going to be the real challenge. Panic started to rise and before I knew it, I'd missed that tiny sliver of an exit that led to the safety of the lobby. I was going around the damn thing AGAIN! 

Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck. Began to freak out properly this time, terrified I'd miss my chance yet again, embarrass myself, and make myself late for my first day on the job. 

By some bizarre miracle of optics, I find myself making eye contact with the hella big security officer sitting behind the reception desk just as I'm coming back around the circle. Through the layers of my glass cage, I can see a curious and mildly horrified expression begin to form on this guy‚Äôs face, which did seem an appropriate response. Time was doing that weird slow-down thing at this point, so it felt like me and this dude were having a really long moment with our eyes locked. Somehow I noticed that he looked like a bigger, bespectacled version of the actor Malik Yoba from *Empire*. Big Yoba with Glasses was looking genuinely concerned about me and my predicament. 

My peripheral vision chose that moment to snarkily reveal the four other people locked inside The Vortex with me, and one of them was looking at me like, wtf woman??? 

The horror.

Suddenly the exit is coming up on my right and I lunge for it, but it‚Äôs too soon and my little glass wedge of The Vortex Pie isn‚Äôt yet open all the way. But I can see the safety of the lobby right there and I am determined to make it out. There is a bit of a scuffle as I continue my death spiral exit attempt, bonking my right shoulder into the outer glass wall of The Vortex in the process. I can't figure out why my extrication is failing till I realize I haven‚Äôt released my death grip on the railing of the glass wall spinning away in front of me. I yank my hands up (too hard!) and continue my lurch outward to the right, barely clearing it as my left shoulder bangs into the other side of the glass cage‚Äôs exit. I hear this strange ""urrff"" sound and realize it is me. Everything around me has gone all echoey, hushed, and lobby-like, so I know I made it out. I feel a wave of relief, but am excruciatingly aware of what a cockup that was. Even worse, I'm just standing there, frozen in place, breathing too hard, holding my arms/hands in an awkward T-Rex sort of stance. The guy behind me collides with my back and butt, almost tripping as he desperately tries to avoid me without falling. 

I realize that I am still staring at Big Yoba the security guard and he is still staring at me. His face looks bigger somehow and then I understand he is moving toward me, and quickly. He has clearly identified me as A Problem, and feels compelled to intervene. I decide that injuries and a mass pile-up would be bad, so I finally drag my feet forward till I am standing in the middle of the lobby and am no longer blocking the revolving door exit. I exhale and it comes out too loud.

Time comes up to normal speed again and then Big Yoba is standing right in front of me with a satisfied sort of half grin. He cocks his head to the side and says, ‚ÄúHey, you made it through! Looked kind of dicey when you went in full tilt, but you came through all right at the end. That door messes with people all the time, so I try to keep an eye out‚Äù He looked so happy for me, like I‚Äôd just unlocked some super hard achievement (which I had). He was so genuinely nice, and so kind in the way he made it all seem so super normal. And just like that, my shoulders dropped back down, and my weird T-Rex hands dropped to my sides. I found myself taking a deep breath as I smiled what I‚Äôm sure was a deranged sort of lopsided grin (my specialty). It was the first time I‚Äôd heard someone use the term full tilt out in the wild and I loved it so much that I wanted to claim it as my own for future use. 

Then I ruined it by blurting out, ‚ÄúYou look like a big Malik Yoba with glasses!‚Äù Shit. Hadn‚Äôt planned to say that outside my head. But his face lit up, and he was like, ‚ÄúReally? You think I look like Yoba? That‚Äôs a great compliment! Thanks for that, Full Tilt! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm gonna call you from now on!‚Äù He pointed at me as he laughed, but in a really nice way, not making fun of me. 

The concept of time snapped me in the face just then and I realized with a start that I only had a few minutes left to get upstairs. I must have looked as freaky outty as I felt, cuz Big Yoba was all, ‚ÄúWhich company you looking for? Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll get you up there.‚Äù He hustled me over to the correct set of elevators, and pressed the call button for me. The doors slid open and as I practically ran in, he leaned around and pressed the floor number for me. Then he gave me this goofy little salute and a conspiratorial sort of wink and said, ‚ÄúKnock ‚Äòem dead!‚Äù as the doors shut. Just a few minutes talking to this super kind stranger, and I felt like I‚Äôd been given this sweet little reset, wiping away the embarrassment and humiliation of my door debacle. I got there right at 9am, and started my new job on time.

The next morning, I went in early and took Big Yoba some pastry and a big fancy coffee drink as a thank you (and no, I did not use the revolving door‚Äìtoo soon). He had this gorgeous book of Batman illustrations open on his desk, and we got talking about great illustrators and how Batman is way more interesting than Superman.

I learned to walk through revolving doors properly after that, with no shoulder injuries, because I realized I just needed to visualize a diagram of my walking path and make sure I followed it. I‚Äôd picture a straight line moving forward, then it suddenly veers right to form a half circle, then another hard right to get back onto that straight line. Sorted. If you weren‚Äôt entirely sure I was neurodivergent, I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve now convinced you. ;-)

I worked with that same company for a few years, and Big Yoba was there most of that time. People always thought I was calling him ‚ÄúYoda.‚Äù Saying hello to him was always the happy, light part of my work day and we had great conversations about good scifi books, comics, and lots of other random stuff. I often brought him fancy, fussy coffees to try (a special interest then/now), the occasional sandwich from the real Italian deli, and a bunch of tamales at Christmas because they were his favorite. He brought me chocolates, sweet little tangerines, and the occasional office orchid in need of saving (we both hated it when people just threw them away). We‚Äôd lend each other a book now and then, having fun talking about them afterwards. I don‚Äôt think we ever exchanged our real names. He just loved being called Big Yoba, and I always liked hearing him say, ‚ÄúFull Tilt!‚Äù 

Meeting my buddy Big Yoba was the big bonus in this tale, just in case it wasn‚Äôt obvious, lol. Being called Full Tilt was a smaller bonus, but it still counts since hearing it always gave me a bit of a giggle.

So basically now I can't help but think about it now. It's usually when I'm at work and my thoughts run free and now I'm really thinking semi-on purpose. I know thinking this is wrong and there are times on which I'm not feeling horrible as I know I should. Am I becoming a monster? I want to break these thought patterns once and for all before I go someplace I will always regret. My greatest fear is that I will start enjoying those thoughts sexually. I know I would never act on them but simply enjoying is worrisome to me. I read somewhere that sexual fantasies don't reflect your orientation (again read my other post) and that's what absolutely terrifies me. I'm taking myself to a place I always feared to be. I told myself ""What are you doing? Why are you purposely dwelling in those thoughts???"" and I have to try to stop. I'm seriously questioning my moral compass now. Why am I doing this? Is it because I secretly like them? Is it because I'm trying to see if they still disgust me? What the hell am I hoping to accomplish doing this?

additionally, my husband doesn‚Äôt seem to do basic things to clean up after himself even though i have expressed to him many times that this is an issue for me (leaving clothes on the ground everywhere, dishes everywhere, garbage everywhere, this kind of thing). this morning the house was a mess and immediately set me off on the wrong foot. my husband asked me why am i being ‚Äòan asshole‚Äô and i expressed that once again it just bothers me that he doesn‚Äôt do the bare minimum to clean up after himself. he freaked out and called me an asshole again and told me to fuck off. he also said i‚Äôm emotionally black mailing him. 

i cried on the couch for ten minutes and after he left i sobbed for ten more minutes on the bed because of the neighbor‚Äôs TV/piano. 

I just needed to vent about this to people who understand. Why is it so much to ask for basic cleanliness and quiet. Why are people so inconsiderate and why can‚Äôt I just be normal. I‚Äôm so exhausted and have to work for almost ten hours now and I just want to keep crying and go to sleep. 

I‚Äôm so grateful for this subreddit because you guys get it. 

Anyways feel free to leave thoughts/advice. I don‚Äôt really have any specific questions. I guess my main question would be what is ‚Äòemotional blackmail‚Äô and what would behavior be that fits this description?

I've trialed a number of antidepressants in that time, each giving me negative side effects and/or severely limiting my range of emotion.

Current psychiatrist recently changed my medicine and I've been having symptoms consistent with serotonin syndrome. Discussed this with him today and he says I haven't given the medicine enough time to be helpful yet. I have been told that exact sentiment by every psychiatrist for every antidepressant I've been on. At this point, I'm unwilling to give months of my life to a new medicine when the pay off seems so nebulous it might not even exist.

I've discussed the symptoms of autistic burnout with this psychiatrist, and he admitted he'd never heard of it and that the symptoms are consistent with depression so they prescribe antidepressants. He couldn't clarify what he meant when saying the medicine would ""help"" and said the drug won't help if I've already written it off. He also kept reiterating that the medicine won't be effective while I'm in my current living situation, again something I've heard before. Seems convenient.

164,How should someone deal with a situation like this?,"['situation', 'deal', 'like']","So I have this coworker who I‚Äôve become good friends with, and he invited me to his 21st birthday celebration.  For the purpose of this post I will refer to him as ‚ÄúKay‚Äù.  Both myself and my coworker are aspies, though that is not the point of my post.  The get together was on some campgrounds, and it was mostly his family and family friends.  I was there with my boyfriend.  

So when I arrived and pulled up in my car, Kay‚Äôs aunt (who I had met once a few days prior) ran up and knocked on my window.  I rolled it down and she somewhat frantically asked me to temporarily pretend that my name was ‚ÄúAlly‚Äù (well, ‚ÄúAlly‚Äù for the purpose of this post).  I was confused and asked why; she started to explain that there‚Äôs this autistic guy there (‚ÄúEvan‚Äù as I‚Äôll call him) that wants to marry Ally but he‚Äôs never met her or seen what she looks like (huh???) and something something, he‚Äôll forget about it shortly after, something something.  I was still confused when Kay‚Äôs mom came over and argued with the aunt that I shouldn‚Äôt pretend to be Ally, because something something, ‚Äúhe could attack her‚Äù (!?!?!), something something‚Ä¶ they quickly stopped talking, as Evan, a very large severely autistic guy, came up to the car and asked if I was Ally.  I had no idea what to say and I just looked at Kay‚Äôs mom until she chimed in ‚Äúno sweety, this is [my actual name].‚Äù  After I gave proper greetings to everyone standing by my car and all of them but Kay‚Äôs girlfriend walking away, I got out of my car and asked her what the deal was.  

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Ally?‚Äù  I said.  She said ‚ÄúAlly from [my and Kay‚Äôs previous company].‚Äù  Dumb me then connected the dots and realized they were talking about another coworker of ours from our previous job, who was planning to be there at his birthday thing but couldn‚Äôt make it because her girlfriend was in the ER.  Kay‚Äôs gf explained it to me that basically upon hearing from K about this girl named Ally that was coming, he decided that he was going to marry her, as I also heard from Evan himself multiple times throughout the night.  He also said that he ‚Äúwant[s] to [do something very inappropriate] to her butthole.‚Äù  

Everyone was kinda just going along with it, whenever he‚Äôd ask ‚Äúwhere‚Äôs Ally?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhen‚Äôs Ally coming?‚Äù They‚Äôd respond with stuff like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, she‚Äôs coming,‚Äù or ‚Äúshe‚Äôll be here soon.‚Äù  No one told him she wasn‚Äôt gonna make it.  At one point Kay‚Äôs mom even tried to reassure him about her not being there by reminding him that they were gonna get married.  

Now I admit that I couldn‚Äôt help but find the ordeal a bit disturbing, especially since it was apparent that Evan had been saying these things since before Ally had said she couldn‚Äôt make it‚Ä¶ what if she had come?  What would Evan do?  Why was Kay‚Äôs mom afraid he would attack me if I said I was her?  Did Kay even tell Ally about the Evan situation?  

Anyway, the point of my post is to ask, what exactly should someone do in that kind of situation?  I‚Äôm not gonna judge him because what the hell do I know, but personally I‚Äôm thinking, well, is it really best to reinforce his false narrative that he‚Äôs gonna marry her just to keep him happy?  Shouldn‚Äôt someone teach him that you can‚Äôt just unilaterally decide to marry someone, explain that no one wants to marry a guy they‚Äôve never met (especially since she‚Äôs a lesbian), tell him to stop making those gross explicit comments about what he wants to do to her body, etc?

So, I'm 34yo; apparently in the spectrum (still waiting on the conclusion/final reports meeting; on September 16th)

I haven't worked in two years (back problems, plus depression), have a house on credit, have a NT (for all we know) partner.

I don't feel like masking anymore. Nor working. Chasing money, or power, isn't my strong suit.

It doesn't go well with NTs. If you don't work, you're a failure in their heads.

Well I've been in lots of works in the past, from IT to CNC operator, ISP technician to a lasagna factory laborer. I don't know where I should redirect. I'm tired of everything, lost interest in many fields.

I came back from a monk's life in Myanmar to help my grandma, who's my last family member I really care for. That's when I met my wife and bought the house.

Everyday I'm looking back at that decision and wonder if I made the right one. Sure there wasn't internet, nor TV, nor money, but you had your shed in the forest, a bed, two meals a day, and zero worries to care for.

My grandma's smile reassure me I've made the right choice, for her, at least.

Maybe I should take some acting classes? I've always dreamed of making dubbing actor, and maybe it would help with anxiety? Either that, or working with animals. I'm fed up with people. Even my friends or partner drain me.

I feel shitty for being a really bad partner for my GF; if I knew all this, I guess I would have avoided the meeting website.

I still struggle in big groups for I don't know when I should talk, with oversharing and being way too excited or eccentric but I have come to terms with it for it is who I truly am. The traits of my autism are still very noticeable and I'm still very shy on certain settings but I'm happy with myself and have more friends (mostly girls) to hang out with so that's all what matters (though Id like to get a gf eventually, guess I can't ask life too much).

182,Looking for advice on my son situation,"['son', 'advice', 'situation', 'looking']","Hello, I'm looking for some advice with other parents that may have gone through a similar situation. My son is 24 years old (almost 25) and is currently at home not doing anything. Keeping things short, High school started out very stressful for him. He didn't attend for the first 3 years. After a lot of work we finally got the help he needed and attended the last two years and to our surprise did very well. We were all shocked (in a very good way) when we saw his grades despite missing out for the first 3 years.   


He made friends, went out and about, was very active and seemed happy. My son looks very nice, he talks and acts like other kids his age and you wouldn't be able to tell he has Asperger's. He told all of us not to tell anyone about his Asperger's. He has had a lot of meltdowns over the years where me and my husband tried our best but I'm not sure if I could do it again. After high school he went to college. All of his teachers were saying wonderful things about our son and how he was top of the class. They even mentioned how much of a good influence he was on other students. His teachers mentioned how they noticed how his communication at first was very weak but noticeably improved after settling in. I'm not sure what happened but for the last 3rd and 4th year of college he changed. He became very quiet and irritable. He was still getting really good grades but something was up. Me and my husband tried talking to him but he didn't want to talk. He got angry and just told us ""nothing was wrong and that he was good"". He finished college and went onto university.   


He went to the introduction on his own, signed all of the paperwork and did all his research on the course he was taking. After three weeks of attending university he just stopped going. He didn't mention why and just stopped. Me, my husband and his older brothers all tried to see why he didn't want to go anymore and again he doesn't want to speak to anyone. From then on its just been going down hill. I don't know how to help him. He stays inside all the time, hates going outside or talking to other people. He cuts his own hair because he doesn't like going to the barber. He goes out of our backyard gate instead of going from the porch because he doesn't want to talk to the neighbours. He hides from guests and doesn't like talking to anyone other than his brothers, his father and me. He has very good smell and can't stand to be in the same room with certain foods. Same with his hearing. Despite not going to university he is still learning online somehow. He is always making things and showing us.   


I am at a total loss. I feel awful. It has been over three years of my son not doing anything and I just don't know what to do. My husband and I found a course where he could study from home (which we though would be easier for him) but he doesn't want to do it. He won't tell anyone what's wrong. I hate to say this but I feel like a terrible mother and that I've failed my son. Has anyone else gone through a situation like this? Please let me know.

I am very shocked at how some people in this subreddit treat others. 

Autism/Asperger's is a spectrum, some people are extremely affected or impaired and require more support than others The fact that you are doing well as an autistic individual doesn't mean everyone can apply what you did to be successful.

Edit: Invalidating other people's struggles and comparing ourselves to others without recognising differences is unhealthy.

Certain factors account for why people go through a lot more than others. It could be demographics, culture, religion, wealth,  educational background, gender, sexuality, parental upbringing, etc.
You may be diagnosed with only Aspergers/Autism, however, let us be respectful of other people on this platform who are heavily impaired by their Autism/Asperger or who have Autism/Aspergers coupled with other comorbidities(ADHD, OCD, BPD, Bipolar, schizophrenia, depression, dyslexia, other mental health disorders, personality disorders and illnesses).

Instead of feeling or thinking people here keep complaining and don't put in much effort, be grateful for where you are in life. Yeah, everyone struggles but let us not forget that some struggle more than others due to varying circumstances.

People come here to vent because they feel we can understand and empathise with them. Not everyone can understand or empathise but we can try to be respectful and kind. I feel instead of only mentioning our achievements and thinking people are not trying enough, let us talk about how autism affects us and give tips on how we overcame these obstacles to get to where we are in life. It will be best to ask questions than assume people are not trying enough. 

I believe this will be a good start to making this subreddit inclusive for every autistic or aspie irrespective of our differences.",wokcjs,218,29,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wokcjs/autismaspergers_is_a_spectrum_there_is_diversity/

I felt so powerless and cowardly which makes me hate myself 100 times more than I did before this accident.

The fact that I could not resist and do anything hurts me so much. Am I that coward? Would I have protected my family if I was with them? Or would I have just let them rob us? I do not think I am worthy enough and this is killing me. I do not understand why such people exist in society.

Edit: Everyone seems like a monster after this accident. I do not know how long this will haunt me.

I just got started at university. All/most students spend the first week doing different activities and getting to know each other, and I'm trying to get out of my comfort zone, so I did it too. ASD has always been a source of insecurity, even though it's an intrinsic part of my identity. I find it hard not to feel alienated by every crowd, even more introverted and quiet people with similar interests. It's like none of the standard social advice matters. I just suck at talking to people. 

When I was there, I had a few conversations that led to dead ends, stayed in the background, and eventually went home. When I left, I felt like crap. I was legitimately on the verge of tears, and I have no idea why it was so intense. 

One of the first things I did was spiral into self-pity and self-hatred. I berate myself for being uninteresting, awkward and weird. I also hate my physical appearance, because I'm really short for being a guy in my 20s, and I have a weirdly child-like face. I'm sure it's not really that big of a deal, but it still seeps into the shit-storm that is my self-perception.

I think the self-hatred stems from the fact that I can never really look at myself as normal. All I can do is work really hard to trick people into believing it, but none of that effort will ever be noticed, because for other people it's completely natural. But I can't blame other people, either. I'm the one on the outside looking in, and I can't expect to be handheld throughout my entire life. Funneling my hatred toward myself seems like the only natural thing to do, and it feels better than constantly feeling helpless and critical of the world around me.

206,"Please help, I fell in love with an asperger girl","['asperger', 'girl', 'love', 'help', 'fell']","**TL;DR**  
>!I met a girl on Tinder, we went on a date and had a great time. She mentioned she wanted to see me again, I said the same thing. This would come up multiple times on the date. Day after date we would text and she'd say she had a great time. Day 3 I say I'd really like to see her soon again and she would not reply. I'm getting anxious and need help to understand the situation better, I really feel for this girl. Understand everything bette by reading the entire thread. Thank you in advance!!!<  


I met this girl on tinder, we chatted for a bit. She would send nice messages but rather summarized - sort of. She would usually be late to respond, but it still felt great. Then she stopped, 2 weeks pass and she ""likes"" the last message I wrote to her and I joked about it being a late ""like"" but better late than never!  


I figured I'd have to ask her out quickly, and I did. I said I'd love to buy her dinner or drinks, she said drinks.  
I looked up a few cool places and gave her two suggestions.  
She replied ""Have you ever been to this place, it's near where I live"".  
It was about 20 more minutes for me but I didn't mind, I had a special feeling about this girl.  
So I asked when she is free and we decided on a day, I figured she wanted to go to this place so I suggested that.  


We meet up, my feelings grew stronger and I got nervous which is something I usually don't get on dates. She liked light lager beer so I ordered one for her and a drink for me.  
She talks with rather low volume and there was a lot of noise around us so I had quite hard time hearing what she said at times, that's when I mentioned I have problems hearing things because I have ADHD and pick up all the different sounds around me.  
Up to this point it was mostly me talking, and nervous as I was already this made me more nervous and I started revealing a lot of things about me that I'd usually ease in on later, like I've saved up money for a lot of years and quit my job to work on myself..  
That's when she mentioned it, she has autism and asperger (I know it's on the spectrum but I don't know how to put it in text otherwise). I did not care at all, I view everyone equal and find these kinda things enriching, normal is boring.  
I don't know much about this other than Asperger has some issues with social skills. This explained why she's been letting me do most of the talking, something I soon forgot as I really don't think about diagnoses as per default, It's just how I work.  
She would open up more, she would laugh when we talk, her eyes lighted up like nothing I've seen before, oh.. Just thinking about it now makes me nearly cry. Her laughter and eyes was nothing but pure joy, I knew I had to get this girl no matter what.  


We finish our drinks and I ask if she wants another, she suggests we go to this other place next door.  
On the way there I realise I had forgotten to put on my glasses (since I wore sunglasses before we entered the building) I put them on and she said she liked them.  
We walk up the stairs and she talks about the building had been a supermarket and a cinema before today and that she liked the original interior on the walls, she had mentioned she liked architecture earlier.  
I showed gratitude in her sharing this and was amazed.  
I order the next drinks too, she had her wallet up but I said I asked her out I want to pay for her, she insisted she would get the next round, I said sure! and smiled.  
We sit down, and she did not say much, just looking around. I got nervous again and felt the need to keep a conversation going (in hindsight I've realised this is normal for people with asperger?), I did not want her to think I'm boring.  
At one point she yawned and excused herself and said that social events can be draining for her, I said it's ok - I do not mind and that I understand, I smiled.  
I settle in a little, maybe because I'm quite tipsy at this point. I look at her, she looks at me. I smile and said that I really like her dress. She thanked me and said it's her moms, I drowned in her eyes and smiled stupid at her and said that she has really beautiful eyes when she smiles.  
She did it again, smiling big, laughing and thanked me for the compliment.  


I notice she seems tired, probably from the event of socialising from what I've gathered. I said I love spending time with her but couldn't help but notice she seemed tired, quickly followed up with a ""I don't mind, don't worry!.  
She said something about it being a bit late, I looked up when my next bus home went, it was about 45 minutes. I said It's a long time, it's ok if she wants to go home but I'd love for her to stay.  
She said it's ok she'll stay a little longer. That made me very happy, I looked at her with stupid love-ey eyes.  
I had finished my drink and she had a little left, I wanted another since it was some time before I had to leave. I said I'd like to get myself another beer and asked if she wanted another one. She said something about no I'm fine, I don't want to be hungover tomorrow.  
I asked if she mind if I get another and she changed her mind, we went to the bar and she got us two beers while I grabbed a glass of water for the both of us.  


She suggested we'd sit in another place, it was a bit less crowded, I said I'm fine wherever so we sat down where she had suggested.  
I felt stupid in love at this point, out of my controll and I couldn't hold it in at this point and I kind of stopped caring, I'd look and smile at her and she would smile back and sometimes dart away with her eyes. I said I've had a really good time with her and I'd love to see her again, I had mentioned this earlier and she'd reply that she would love to go for a walk and she is free till the end of this month, then school would start.  
Once more, she would reply that she also had a great time and we should go for a walk and bring my dog (she loves dogs). I agreed.  


Eventually I had to go, we go to the restroom together and I realise I wont make it to my bus at this point but I just didnt care.  
We walk slowly towards my bus. I see it in the distance knowing I'll miss it. I mention this to her and say I don't want to rush this.  


I ask where she's heading, she points and I realise this is where we split. I say good bye and I hug her softly but with emotion. I could feel she was not comfortable hugging and she kinda froze so I let go. It did hurt for me a little, I'm very affectionate. But I figured it's because of asperger/autism so I kinda shook it off.  


Next day  
I had written to her on the way home saying that I was really greatful for a great evening with her wishing she was not too hungover and that she fell asleep pleasantly (she had mentioned she has a hard time falling asleep)  
She would respond mid-day saying ""No thank you! It was really nice :) I fell asleep immediatly when I got home, did you get home alrightt?""  
I mentioned I got home late because they had some issues. We had talked about music and I had mentioned some songs, she had asked me to send them to her so I did.  
She would ""like"" the message and write  
""Oh no, that sucks! Did you have to wait for a long time? :(""  
I said I got home pretty late but that I did not mind, I asked how the flee market and beach was today (she mentioned on the date that she would do this the day after)  
She would reply late, like after 23:00 saying ""It was good, just got home :) Soon I'm going to eat dinner... Got a bit late today, how was your day?""  
I'd respond that it must be nice to be home and ask if she found anything nice, sorry she got home late but hopefully she could eat \*\*\*\* dish because she had mentioned it's pretty much the only thing she likes followed by a quirky ;) :P emoji. I said my day has been great even if I went up late.  


She didn't respond to that message for the entire day.  
The next day (two days after the date) I'd think of her a lot. I started worrying she did not like me, I googled for hours and watched videos about people with asperger to try and understand better. I got a better picture of it all but nothing that fitted my situation, that's why I'm here. I spent hours writing a poem while waiting for her response. I knew she had been late responding before but anxiety started growing on me, I started to get really sad. I cried for a long time, and didn't feel like doing anything, I got kind of depressed. At around 18:30 I couldn't wait longer, and I had about aspies liking clear messages and sometimes having a hard time knowing what to respond to certain things. I wrote  
""How's your week looking? I would really like to see you soon again :)""  
No response.  


Today, three days after the date.  
Still no response, I'm still trying to learn and understand, these are my thoughts at this point  
‚Ä¢ She ignores me because she didn't like me. Even if we had a great time and both of us mentioned we wanted to see each other again multiple times.  
‚Ä¢ She needs time to recharge for a new event and she might be anxious to respond because she doesnt want to make plans yet  
‚Ä¢ She's busy and has her mind elsewhere and is focused on one of her interests.  


So ***please***, anyone with asperger/autism spectrum or anyone with experience of people with it, help me out dealing with this situation. I don't want to overload her but I need to get a better understanding because the silence is killing me emotionally.

207,Does anyone feel like NT's gaslight you?,"['gaslight', 'nt', 'feel', 'does', 'like']","I was having a discussion or reddit recently, the other person I was talking with said that I was behaving like an autistic because I kept linking definitions to the words they were using.

They said that I didn't understand because I was autistic, but normal people get it, and I shouldn't break down conversations into what their words mean, that NT's just get the context and although the words they are using don't mean what they say they mean, neurotypicals get the idea.

I am used to this behaviour, I don't let it bother me; but, they kept on insisting that it was me that was the problem in the communication.

Eventually it turned out that what they meant ""was the origin of"" rather than ""brings"", which to me is a big difference.  For example, clouds bring water, but they are not the origin of said water.

I've read in some other subreddits of people talking with nerodivergent people saying that we get caught up on one point that doesn't matter and we should just leave it alone.

I feel like this may be both fair and unfair, the problem I see with just letting things go like that is that it has lead to miscommunications in the past. For example, I arranged to meet someone at our local college over email, they agreed and on the day of said they were in their way to the university.  I corrected them that I was at the college and they ended up going to the university and we didn't meet up.

It sucks when this happens, because I want to be a part, but every person has their ""this means that"" code in their brain that I don't know. When they further blame me for trying to be clear, I feel like it is gaslighting when they don't have a proper grasp on the language they are speaking.",woejek,132,104,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/woejek/does_anyone_feel_like_nts_gaslight_you/

213,Do you identify with animals and why?,"['animals', 'identify']","Pretty self-explanatory. Have you ever felt an affinity for a particular species? If so, which species and why?

To start off, I've often felt an affinity for dogs and wolves. Like them, I have a very strong sense of loyalty toward those I consider my pack, which in turn reflects an intense desire for connection and belonging as opposed to isolation and rejection. I also feel that my outward appearance conceals rather than conveys my true nature; I'm a White male larger than average, so many may see me as a big, tough guy but they never see my intense anxiety or emotional sensitivity akin to how people misjudge wolves or dogs based on their appearances. Wolves may seem very intimidating and savage, but in reality they are very shy and will do all they can to avoid humans (sound familiar?). And dogs have been subjected to exploitation and abuse, even by just existing in some cases. For instance, English bulldogs are so inbred they can barely breathe, they need human intervention to breed (artificial insemination and C-sections) and have an average life expectancy of only six years, and this sorry health state was caused by humans because we think THIS is cute or awesome or perfect. While I have not experienced harm anywhere NEARLY as bad as dogs, I have experienced trauma at the hands of others, both as a kid and in more recent times.

Most the time from the daily repetitiveness  in them from daily quests. Games have been a big part of my life since i was a child. I used to play world of warcraft but it because  it was to toxic for me i quit it so i went to join final fantasy 14 . Been playing it for over 2 years. This game has been mostly kind and understanding until a year ago when wow players moved to ff14.  

Due to sensory overloads i have to play certain ways in order to not get over stimulated . No sound and with calming music in my headset and i have to take breaks if i get to bad . I tried turning my graphics to low but i ended up just dying more due to not seeing.

My house this past week weve had construction in the backyard beside our house and in front of us. For days its been happening and hours and hours every day.  Its safe to say ive not been doing well and living with nonstop sensory issues. My headphones dont work nothing has.

Sadly due to my job i had a few days to finish a event on the game and was trying to run it the other day and someone kept griefing me on my dps not  being good enough while i was healing. They told me i had to dps a certain way i could not due to the graphics. Theres another aspie in my free company who has the same issue with the spell and he stays away from it when he can as well. I ignored them the first 2 times this person tried to tell me i was playing wrong. Then the third time i had to tell them as much as they think they might be helping i have aspergers and im playing whats best for me right now because of the graphics of the spell. He apologized because he didnt know then continued on and told me i should still do it as im not helping the team due to it. I told him in my almost 3 years ive had no one have issues on how i played. His dps buddy joined in and started harassing me to tell me i was griefing the group and they could get me banned for it because im not playing to the classes full potential. I ended up so stressed out i died in game to leave the dungeon and logged off.

I informed my free company i will likely quit the game due to it . My guild mate who is also a aspie stepped up and offered to make the remaining runs i needed as easy as possible so i could collect my last item

But my problem is that i always felt dumb and silly socially and intelectually. My psychiatrist is very cool with me( he is a neuroscientist too) and he tells me that i'm intelligent and etc but i can't ""believe him"". Whenever he says that i tell him that he is mistaken and/or i think that i'm some sort of sociopath and that because of that i'm deluding him too believe that i'm intelligent. I was not very good at the school because of life issues for most of my school time and my low self esteem always held me back to overcome this issue. Now i plan to enter a technical engineering school( that is very hard) but i'm feel that i am becoming better and better at stems related topics since i'm learning by myself with books and internet(mostly youtube and online exams of famous tests (like SAT, but where i live is a different one). I see that my NT friends are mostly confident all the time and although they are not super smart they seem to, by not caring at all, outcome their intellectual ""impairments"" while in this sence i do not.

This made them upset so they tried stigmatizing me by saying things such as ""where did you get that from stupid Wikipedia"" to make me upset so I can tell them the site I get my information from. I didn't lie and the information was real but I didn't get it from a site it's just an opinion from me not a fact. This person was an old bully of mine trying to get information from me to be able to do their jobs better because they knew I had a passion for it.

I found many others who try to challenge my knowledge and if they can't beat me they will go to extreme lengths to try and win some imaginary competition they have against me. Some will threaten, get angry, start throwing things not at me but in the environment, try ganging up on me, slandering my name , or anything else you can think of bullies did back in highschool.

I always find these people by accident and it's as if I've had a target on my back from them. It's always someone with an ego, a power trip, trying to show off a meaningless title, degree, car, job outline, muscles, something they're proud of. I don't notice them right away of course. I get into a conversation normally and they eventually act out on me. 

I don't compete with others, try to show off, brag or do anything else I'm speaking but these people project onto me and start attacking. They seem to do anything they want and when they can't get there way they come up with bad ideas.

Does this happen to anyone else?

I spoke to my doctor about it and after explaining every detail to them they realize it's not me it's them and there self esteem is being hurt, maybe jealousy, maybe they're reflecting on something, or anything else you can think of at least that's the opinion.",wogdnu,10,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wogdnu/does_anyone_else_have_issues_with_egocentric/

231,I'm struggling with uni,"['uni', 'struggling']","Hi all! As the title says, I've been having some difficulties with my university study which I think are connected to my Asperger's, so I figured I'd ask here. For some background, I'm a first year Education student in Queensland, Australia, on a throwaway because I have personal information on my main. 

I'm four weeks into my second semester of university. I got good results academically in my first semester, and thanks to meeting some extroverts, I've not had a difficult time socially either. But, despite those positives, something's still very wrong. I struggle with studying even for five hours per class per week (it's recommended to do ten), I can't really focus on my readings, and I burn out incredibly quickly and often can't restart for the day once I've done so.

While I know the last one is autistic burnout, I'm not really sure how to deal with it effectively. I think the first two could be connected to my choice of degree, though. I wasn't fully passionate about teaching when I chose it; I only did so because it seemed the best of all of my options. I'd just change or drop out if I felt anything at all for any other (realistic) career path, but I don't. (An additional thing that I take into account with them is that, while this has worked for me so far in uni, I have a small feeling that it won't always, and a much larger feeling that it won't if I do end up teaching).

I'd love some advice on this. At the moment, it just feels like there isn't really a place for me here.",wooizm,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wooizm/im_struggling_with_uni/

Feel free to ask questions about the poem and offer critiques if you have them. Anyway here‚Äôs the poem:

‚ÄúThe viceroy bares his colors bright
In nature‚Äôs dystopia so dark

I've read how not having a filter or being blunt is trait that individual on the autism spectrum have. 

I've never had that, I always aim to be honest but tactful even as a kid, but the only time am blunt is when I get agitated with someone who I feel is taking advantage of me.

I'm not really bothered by crowd spaces, loud environments or certain textures, although hearing people smacking while eating does drive me up the wall. 

I do however feel like i miss certain social cues. I can see when someones angry, nervous, sad, not wanting to be bothered, but I seem to miss certain things that other people pick up on easily. I'm not good with conversations with strangers, and I never feel like I fit in anywhere in groups, even with the so called outcast, though I do find that eventhough it's rare i do click well with certain individuals that seem to really like me. I've had times where people would be friendly to me and become cold and distant over time without knowing why, which makes me suspect that I'm missing pieces of the puzzle sort to speak.

236,Job struggle/overthinking ACT,"['job', 'act', 'struggle', 'overthinking']","I need advice

Does anyone else struggle with their job acceptance?

I never had luck with jobs, until my last two, one lasted 8 years, the last one (current one) so far 4.

As most people, with Autism/Aspergers, struggle with anxiety, depression, imposter syndrome and self doubt, my current struggle everyday is trying to accept that this is my job, it‚Äôs never going to get any better/worse, you have one, be grateful and shut up.

But I always feel like I am smarter than this, I feel like I could be doing something better, something that might earn way more money, be satisfying.
I grew up with a mentality of 
‚ÄúFind something you love doing/are good at, and get paid to do it, then everyday you don‚Äôt feel like work‚Äù 
I know the things I enjoy doing, but they can‚Äôt be monetized. 

I feel blessed that I have no stress in my job, and it is super easy, but easy to the point, that if work discovers, that a monkey could do my job I‚Äôm fucked. 

I would love just a little more responsibility or tasks, but I think that would push my stress levels, plus what I do now, has no repercussions if something goes wrong, there is no flow on effect/chain reaction, and I feel if I did something else, there would be moments where my actions could backfire. Like I have a computer degree, but I know my strengths and weaknesses, and feel if I got a job in tech support, I would feel horrible if I fixed a persons computer and something went wrong, I know what I can do, and I know what I can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt want to risk it.

It seems to me, that I have the perfect job, but I always want something else, or feel like it is shitty
I have no career progression, there is no corporate ladder, but I have no helicopter monitoring (like to the point I don‚Äôt exist) don‚Äôt get me wrong I am respected and acknowledged, but I very rarely get checked on, I feel invisible. The only stress I really have in every situation is put on myself, example
Getting to work on time, I start at 8:30, but am I chastised if I am not there on time no
Am I questioned, no, and I investigated, no,
But I put the stress on myself to get there, I feel pretty certain I could come in at 9 and be perfectly fine.

I enjoy what I do, thanks to COVID I have every Friday WFH, so I essentially have a day off, and get paid for it, it just feels too easy, and I feel underutilized, but at the same time I would feel super stressed if my daily tasks were changed/altered for new ones that might stress me out more than I already am through self imposition.

I need a way to learn acceptance, enjoy what I do, not stress and try to mentally pour freezing cold water on my head, in an effort to stop my brain overheating/stressing itself out, overthinking and working itself to death over this.",wojqww,3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wojqww/job_struggleoverthinking_act/

(Replaced lengthy introduction and going straight to the point :) )

I always had a hard time adapting myself to the neurotypical world. In college, I found this girl I liked, and would do anything to stay with her (despite my complete lack of social skills, specially at that time). My persistence paid of. We ended up marring and have 2 boys today.

However, she's totally neurotypical, and has always more endured this part of me rather than accepted it. Me, with a complete lack of self esteem, always accepted being put down. I tried my best to be what she wanted, but could only go so far. 

In this process I abandoned all of my interests (except programing, which is my job and therefore socially acceptable). In the end, I ended up loosing myself, with depression.

What I wanted to ask, specially to the older of you, is: how did you handle your interests against a world that is not really tolerant to them? Did you abandon them like me? Did you stick to them despite the rest of the world?



Ps. Currently,  after long years of therapy, I found something called ""self esteem"", which is making my marriage fall apart...

I had never been clubbing before, didn't really think that'd be my scene. One of them knew it was my first time and really looked out for me, and I had a great time despite not drinking. Best night I've had in ages, and for the first time in forever I woke up the next morning feeling content, and that feeling lasted a couple of days. Also met a guy, he bought me a drink first, we got chatting in the smoking area, and found out we shared several interests including some niche ones, had a great chat. Got his handle so we'll hopefully catch up again. 

Went out again yesterday, went to the pub first this time and it was a good laugh. Also got chatting with a guy who was on a stag do but lost the rest of the party, so asked him to join us. Hadn't even been there half an hour probably, and a girl came up to me on the dance floor, started putting her hands on me. I probably should have realised she wanted me to reciprocate or dance with her, so she ended up going of with someone else from our group. He bought her a drink and they danced together a lot throughout the evening, which I guess I regret but it's a learning point.

243,"I see often the claim that ""Autism/Aspergers is good actually in part because we are more likely to be completely honest' or something similar. This is incorrect.

Some of us may pride ourselves on telling the truth always, but that's not a good thing and shouldn't be counted as a 'good' thing about Aspergers/Autism.

For one, we can lie just as much as anyone else. Honesty isn't our domain, and just because we might tend to be more honest, that doesn't mean everyone else is always deceitful and such.

For two, unless you are a deontologist (and if you are...WHY?!), telling lies when they create more good is important to do so. Generally yes telling the truth is a good thing because we do best when given access to accurate knowledge. But it's equally important to know when to tell someone a lie.

A classic example is ""Is it moral to lie to a murderer who is asking you where a potential victim is?"" Hopefully you would say 'Yes, it is moral.'

Another example is the lack of filter in someone's thoughts that allows them to be verbalized.

In the last few days, I‚Äôve been to parties or seen friends every day. Going from the quiet of small towns in Italy and the relative peace of Berlin back to the chaos that is Brooklyn was a shock. I had a nice morning working in a garden, but when I went to my friends apartment, all of the sounds + the residual energy of all of the social time caused me to curl up into a ball on the couch and shut down. Three different songs were playing simultaneously at a block party outside. The scent of the detergent from my clean shirt felt like it was holding me captive. Time felt like it had slowed to a halt. I found myself unable to speak or move, even when I was asked if I was okay.

My friend left the room, then came back with a pair of noise canceling headphones and told me to see if they would help. They sat next to me while I put them on. As soon as they were over my ears, i felt it: relief. Everything was quiet. The sounds of the block party faded, my heart rate slowed down, i could breathe, I could think. I immediately started crying as I smiled to myself. My friend put their legs on top of me, acting as a weighted blanket.

This past year has been THE year for me - veil has been lifted, I see all the evidence and possible counter-evidence in front of me, from my early childhood behavior, parents, social life and ways of behaving/learning/expressing interest. I started smoking weed around the same time, leaving a 12-step program after years, which saved my life from  addiction and the addict lifestyle but also drastically fucked me up. Anyways separate issue. 

When I settle down at night, weed gives me what feels like a temporary neurotypical brain. At the least, it makes me perceive myself in a way that feels more 'full' and accurate. I usually get embarrassed and delete any stories I posted that day. I also have insights that I write down, that I wouldn't have 'sober'. It immediately neutralizes my intense overwhelming moods when I am overstimulated by stress. It feels like a valuable tool for me. 

But over the last year I feel like I've gotten progressively worse around people. I used to vibe with some coworkers at least, to some extent, now my presence is like a weird and dark cloud. I'm getting all those subtle signals of being disliked and I can't tell if it would have been different otherwise. I think self-awareness can be a self-fullfilling prophecy, but my old way of denying and ignoring my differences put me in an equally bad place.

261,i'm better off alone,['better'],"The title says it all. This is very pathetic rant about me being socially stupid. I have always felt little odd about platonic relationships and it never really went away as time got by. Making friends feels like two persons try to understand each other but there is this invisible wall that only I'm aware of; and it's my autism.

This has happened to every relationship I've had. None of them are meaningful to me, quite frankly i just really dislike my friends (or rather the relationship to that person that I'm part of). Longest friendship is over ten years and she is fine but whenever we talk or hang out (once in a year) things feels off. Obviously the relationship is great when it begins but when we both grow up/mature the security (i guess) goes away. I can't really put it in the words but it's the weird feeling of me being awkward and incapable and that fuels my self-hatred towards platonic relationships.

It's weird because this has never happened with romantic partners. 

Misunderstandings are really common and most of my friends still don't get it that I don't wanna hurt them intentionally. I always apologize when I realise I have been/done something hurtful unintentionally, but the responses are usually pretty dull. My head gets stuck on the things I fail and I can't escape it easily by myself. 

I think it would be safer to cut contact to everyone expect my partner and family, because all I do is fuck things up. 

Do other asperger feel this way? 

Tldr: i don't need friends they disappoint me.

I also am neurodivergent, and have some anxiety issues,  I have fear of driving and I would have to have someone send me to work whenever boss asked me to come to office. (I mostly do still work from home and only commute to office twice a week).

 Almost none of my cousins ever helped us financially or offered to unless we explicitly asked. My dad died last year and we have been having great financial problems since. 

I was also feeling burnt out at work and having Aspergers cause me to have great communication problems. I also work in a job where you have to have clear requirements before working on a project and to write a response and question and plan out my communication each time is a nightmare for me. I think that was what made me burnt out. We have communication via zoom and slack yet sometimes asking requirements when the documents are incompletes -I feel like it's hard for me. I also have ADHD on top of that.

I mostly keep my difficulties secret as I have no choice. I also wasn't professionally diagnosed because I simply cannot afford it, last time i checked it costs thousands of dollars where I live. 


I also have no friends living near me and even the friends that I have didn't reply to me much and we kinda on hiatus because of how busy we are. Plus, having driving anxiety sometimes prevent me from meeting up with them.

I am not in my 30s yet but I feel scared this is how life was like for me from now on. What if there is no future down the line for me? I have no potential spouse , no money, siblings who also have anxiety so they don't talk to me, no cousins checking up on me, I feel like I'll ended up alone , with a job that judges my social skills hence more anxiety for me, and also no one to talk to.

I remember seeing questions on tests that might as well have been something like this (made up exaggerated example):

Bobby is on a boat with his girlfriend in the middle of a lake just shy of a forest. He can feel the wind in his hair. His girlfriend is playing a ukulele, which he enjoys. He brought with him a bunch of well-maintained fishing gear and an old pair of binoculars. Bobby had a good day on the boat. Why was Bobby on the boat?

A. He wanted to spend quality time with his girlfriend

B. He wanted to catch fish

C. He wanted to reminisce about the days he spent finding rare fish with his dad by trying to spot them in the clear lake with binoculars

D. Bobby is a professional ventriloquist and he eats baby food

Now obviously, D is the wrong answer. And there's a chance I would rule out C, because even though it could very well be correct, there was nothing in the first paragraph mentioning Bobby's dad (and I know a little bit about how neurotypicals want you to think). But I'd get stuck on the first two because they both seem like reasonable answers and I don't have enough information on Bobby to truly know. 

I'd raise my hand and say ""both of these look like they could be the right answer,"" and the teacher would tell me ""just pick which one seems the *most* right."" Every time a teacher told me that I'd just glitch out and think what the fuck?? The most right?? What are you talking about, this is a poorly written question. And I'd have like a 50/50 chance of getting those questions wrong every single time, while acing the other categories of the same test that weren't focused on ""reading comprehension.""

279,Feeling confused about my autism diagnosis,"['autism', 'diagnosis', 'confused', 'feeling']","I've been lurking on some autistic forums for a while now and I feel in a really weird spot in terms of my position. I feel like I'm in some weird intermediate position between very mild autism and a nerdy neurotypical. And it makes me feel kind of alone, like I can't really relate to anyone. I was diagnosed with autism when I was four, BTW.

I mean I do have obvious traits of autism like having special interests on an intense level, and sensory issues, like when I wake up and feel shrink-wrapped and swollen. I stim and sometimes I get annoyed with negative surprises, like having to do something I don't like when I didn't think I expect I was gonna have to that thing. And I haven't always been as good at socializing as I am now.

But lately I've been doubting my autism too. I notice that a lot of autistic people sometimes see the world in a sort of different way than I do. Sometimes they don't understand WHY there are certain social norms when to me they seem pretty obvious to me. Like I've seen examples where they don't understand why people say something they don't mean or why they shake hands. I mean, sometimes you just gotta be courteous and use a traditional response because obviously people don't think you literally mean what you say, sometimes you just gotta be polite, and shaking hands is just something you do and I thought everyone kinda understood what it meant. Questioning this kinda stuff seems kinda irrelevant to me and makes me uncomfortable.

I mean I probably used to be slightly more autistic in this regard but lately I've been noticing improvements where I understand more social nuances and that sometimes the subconscious and experience is what helps you understand things and have accepted that you can't just explain everything with words. Not everything is based on logic, because we can say ""Why is?"" for a lot of things and we just won't know. But we just do things to be polite and that's that. Thinking too deeply about this stuff makes my head spin. I don't want things to be 100% structured, some looseness in the mix is very healthy and pleasant too. Too much rigidity is very unhealthy, cuz the world is infinite shades of gray. There has to be a balance for nuances.

But I can't say I'm neurotypical either because I used to have a lot more autistic traits in the past. I didn't know how to interact with others well in middle school. I talked too much and didn't know how to act the correct way for people to like me. It wasn't till high school where I learned to socialize.

I guess maybe I just learned social norms very slowly other people rather than just not learning them at all. Or maybe OCD therapy helped me stopped seeing the world in black and white (I have OCD too). Or maybe i just live in an relatively autistic-friendly environment where certain autistic quirks are tolerated. Who knows? But I do have some autistic traits. I just find it pretty easy to navigate myself socially I guess, compared to when I was in middle school.

Or... maybe I've just been taking what people say about their experiences too literally which makes it seem like I'm less autistic than I really am to myself.

288,"Just finished my 2nd week at my new job and lunch time terrifies me, please help","['lunch', 'job', 'terrifies', 'help', 'week']","So I've come to terms with the fact that I have asperger's so I feel like this is the place to ask for help from similar minded people.

So just a little background first... my first job after graduation was a remote dev job which I stayed at for two years because of covid, thanks to that I haven't had to deal with working in an office and all the things that come with it, so when that startup crashed I had to find another job, which I did, and I just finished my 2nd week there. Working in an office 9 to 5 has been a completely different experience. I'm more focused and productive at work due to less distractions than at home, but I'm also an awkward mess around other people, particularly at lunch break. There's an hour where people gather and sit together for lunch and it terrifies the shit out of me, so I leave the office and grab lunch from a nearby restaurant or fast food place and wait out the hour doing nothing or catching up on my reading on my tablet (not even using social media because I hate it, also no friends so no point).

The reason I'm terrified of these is because social settings disorient me, literally. I become unable to see anything or anyone, and I can't focus on any particular voice because it's all overwhelming. If I had a chance to meet everyone one at a time I think I would've been fine, but in a group setting it's impossible and they all sit in groups, it's even worse with the opposite sex involved, at least 100x worse. I also have social anxiety so I have to struggle not to hyperventilate after a while and escape to the nearest restroom. There's also another thing making the social settings so difficult: I usually have nothing to say and my quietness repels people (naturally, since they want to talk).

What can I do to not seem so antisocial? it's only my third week (next week) and I'm still within probation so I'm worried this affects how they evaluate me. But outside of that, personally I really want to be somewhat social as I'm extremely lonely, but I don't even know what to do at such times when I'm so boring to talk to.

I'm currently in a relationship that's becoming more serious with my highschool crush 23(f). Everything is going very good however I'm trying to find a way to break it to my crush that she probably has Asperger's. I mean she has the background for it. She was born to an older mother, and had a turbulent childhood with dad being an addict. So she has the background. She has also struggled with maintaining friends and romantic relationships. One example is she doesn't understand when romantically annoying me goes to just flat out making me mad. She also has a delayed empathetic responses (ie it'll take hours for her to process empathy to a situation requiring it and then express empathy). Like when I need emotional reassurance she is super delayed and her initial responses to just stick her tounge out multiple times just really irks me.  For context I only want to do this to help them because they've always had a messy social life. I'm just now teaching her social boundaries. For example how some gestures can come off sexual and sending the wrong message to people. I'm not in over my head or anything. But I do get frustrated.

295,How to lessen the effects of things stuck in my head? And become stronger in stressful situations.,"['stressful', 'stuck', 'stronger', 'head', 'things']","So there's an event that happened a few months ago, that has been stuck in my mind ever since. So im May, I was in a class with a pretty annoying teacher, very threatening, not allowing any mistakes or different learning technicues. One time he yelled at a kid in my class for ""not listening to him"", he was reading the book, which is a good way of learning for some people. He was not causing any problems with that. But it was too long ago, and I don't remember the details, it could have been possible for him to done something that caused the yelling. But anyways, not a teacher I like. So we had scissors because we were doing some kind of folder for a project, and in my group there's this guy I'm talking to, and then I get a genious idea to pretend that I'd cut his hair with the scissors and moved them a little bit closer to his head (note: still a good way from his head, at least the length of a full-size computer keyboard) and he started yelling at me. (and I do disclose that I screwed up, not trying to hide it. That was a stupid joke, but I've done so before in this school \[with a different teacher\] and thought I could do the joke. I get that the teacher thought it looked like I was attacking or something, but let's move forwalds) with a lot more power than neccessary, for example I've never broke any rules on his classes, so a quick warning yell and a little speech about how it was dangerous but this guy just keeps yelling at me at full volume how the school should be safe for everyone, which I agree. But I almost start crying, but still keeping it in, but not managing to look normal and I did look like I was about to cry. So this thing gets stuck in my mind, overtaking a few old intrusive thoughts. The next week rolls around, I get through the last class of the year with this guy fine, and go on my vacation. The thing pops up whenever I'm with friends from school or home, so it did ruin my vacation in a way. But I could escape it for good periods for time, which was good but still annoying. So now school has started, I can't escape, it's stuck on my mind always, which has ruined my week. Monday we have the first class of year with this teacher, and I'm just constantly thinking about this guy. Every time I see him I start minorly panicking. What should I do? The things I used to escape previous intrusive thoughts don't work and yeah. I'm constantly thinking about how I'm gonna get him back, I feel like yelling at him, I feel anger torwalds him, I feel just escaping the whole school system and nothing feels fun anymore. And I've been in a situation like this before, when I was still playing sports I got yelled at for going outside when we were not meant to and the whole group of the outside escapees got yelled at. Cried myself to sleep (this was on a camp where I was alone, so i't was a mix of missing home and fear) and that event let me to quit the team after the season.

Things I've tried: Telling myself I'm not interested and every time I thought I'm not interested about it a dragon gets a hit that's preventing me from being happy

Meditating: Not working, my mind just escapes thinking about this. Of course it's a skill I should learn, but no results yet.

At this point I'm thinking about switching schools, I know there's a special needs school about 30 mins away, so that could be an option, switching to my friends class that doesn't have this teacher, and just skipping the days of the classes. Or are these thoughts just something I've got to deal with for the reminder of my school days/teenage years? These might just be related to my OCD, but I really don't know. Along with the assholes there it's not really fun to be at school anymore.

I hate middle school.

296,Is it fixated interest? And do burnouts cause lack of fixated interests?,"['burnouts', 'fixated', 'interests', 'lack', 'cause']","So I am the type of person who loves saving photos of her favorite celebrities. For years and years and years I saved them according to month, year, type of photoshoot, name of the magazine. If I didn't have a month, I couldn't stop until I found it somewhere. I liked to know what hair style they had in what year. 

They also made me translate magazine interviews, lyrics, sub videos and TV shows, make a fanpage, share it with other people. Talking about them, imagining scenarios about them. Emotionally depending on them and learning from them. Analyzing their reactions and expressions, gestures and clothes and everything. They made me happy.

I didn't really like if anyone else showed me an other group (idols) they like because I wanted to get to know groups by myself, without anyone's assistance, when I wanted. I guess this is me growing up stubborn as hell.

Presenting my faves to others give me such high adrenaline it made me tremble and sweat (sorry). 

After some time life got rough and I got occupied with decision making and constantly changing my mind because I didn't know what I wanted from life or who I am really. I got depressed and my interests didn't help me anymore. But now when I got back to them, I felt like my long lost excited child self has found her way back - or maybe I went to pick her up where I left her - and I felt that incredibly strong, overwhelming love and the many feelings I am unable to explain in any words. Now I want to translate again. I want to talk about them in such an ecstasy that it makes me smile from ear to ear and makes my eyes shine, and as my best friend would say ""you are living up all your happiness talking about them"".

Can fixated interest disappear because of life and can it have such a strong impact on your emotional wellbeing that later you might realize that their absence just made everything a bit worse, even though during those time you didn't feel this exact thing?

To add: meanwhile I wasn't stanning them, I was stanning other groups, actors and if it comes to my faves, I still can spend hours saving their photos, categorizing and appreciating them, also translating if I have the time.

It works differently with different companies, but to put it simply you go to the place you're needed at whatever time you're needed (outskirts of Stratford at 2am? Yes boss!), and you lump shit about, or you assemble shit while a cunt shouts at you.

It can pay quite well, if you sleep rough and hop the tube, but it's horrible. The culture is pretty macho, you are expected to do dangerous and unpleasant things with a kind of machismo. It's hard to make friends or even have a chat if you're unloading a lorry or whatever and I have zero small talk anyway. So, it's very lonely despite being also far too crowded. I have always in the past had some kind of meltdown after some months of this job, whilst sleeping rough. Sometimes I've bawled out the crew chief and kicked things over on the way out and sometimes I just packed it in, abruptly. Either way, I always feel terrible at the end of a season and spend the winter depressed.

Now, I've been working in Care for a few years but a lull in business means I could go and do a few 80 hour weeks in London and put myself ahead of the game.

323,"Special Interests and work in America ""doesn't mix""","['interests', 'work', 'america', 'special', 'doesn']","Work is a place people spend the most of their time. Knowing this I chose to seek something that brought both a soul to my life as well as an aim. In my early 20's I sought to only work in aviation, having a plethora of jobs at airports as a result. It didn't take long to see just how passionless the American work life was, not to mention how boxed in it was. Most who excel in such area's usually have had familial ties to the environment. This is where I personally differentiated from the rest. I sought to work around aircraft so I could be around what interested me, not just a place to get a paycheck.

Luckily, due to the lack of soul people brought to the airport, I had a means of escape for the most part. I could walk the ramp alone with a coffee looking at whichever aircraft I desired to alone. However, that experience was one of the last places I'd worked around aircraft. It wasn't easy to find a place with as much freedom that fueling gave me. The first job I had working around aircraft was at the age of 19-20, which was aircraft detailing and cleaning. Sun Country's 737's and a few private jets. Being that it was my first time, I was like a kid in a candy store. Prior to that the closest I'd get was from google images. Seeing it in person meant touching it, seeing the shapes, overlooking the design. During one of my breaks I took the time to walk around the aircraft. My manager at the time pulled me aside to tell me that the way I was looking at the aircraft had my coworkers concerned. I suppose I somehow felt ashamed of my curiosity; which was rather similar to the social treatments in regards to my curiosity of the opposite sex. It instilled me with a kind of subconscious anxiety anytime I desired to be curious later on. Not only was I socially anxious, I was anxious to be curious, how trivial.

I kept the fueling job for 2 years, which was the longest. However the conditions weren't ideal. More so because management was rather sloppy. Working 16 hour overtime shifts at moments notice barely having any time to shower off the jet fuel. It was when this 'exploitation' got rather toxic that I really began to bottle up emotions. I loved working around aircraft but the people were making the rather easy work next to impossible; or just unnecessarily difficult. I'd spend my breaks either walking the ramp or in the terminal as, most of them would sit around watching TV while bitching and moaning. That toxicity wears off on you. I quit after they'd tried to give me a late flight, making a 16 hour overtime shift a 17. Before it reached that point, I suppose my ego was in fear of its own destruction. I'd applied to both Delta Airlines and Southwest 15 times each to no avail. Hope was wearing thin and I feared what I'd have to do for work with aviation not in my life. Safe to say that fear was very valid. Call it loosing a part of yourself. It's what'd lead to many private meltdowns, fearing what'd become of me if I left it.

Depression never really reached its darkest until I left the airport. I still clung on to existence but barely, by a thin thread. Worked at a few factories, with remnants of my passion following me. Worked at a door manufacturing plant. While on my breaks, I'd collected random scraps of wood to create a wing and I did. Everyone else looked at me like I was insane, so be it. The other factories were worse. One of them I had to reach a not so picturesque state of mind, telling myself ""pretend you're in prison and you've gotta work to be free"". ""Arbeit Macht Frie"" comes to mind. In such a place I romanticized saving up $10K so I could purchase a motorcycle and take about 5 lessons in a helicopter. I was fired a month later for not showing up to weekend overtime. Because, remember, this isn't your life! I remember having a similar fantasy of working a good 40 hour week at another job and spending a paycheck on a helicopter lesson once I'd found out a company I knew had purchased a gorgeous newly built French helicopter called a Cabri G-2. However, once I made such a plan, my manager started docking my hours. Why? Well, in my review his reasons were because I'd carry coffee with in the halls. I had a wonderful meltdown after that 'review'.

Of course, given that my middle name is double standard, I couldn't stand this guy and everyone else was simply telling me to deal with it. Once I left, they then started speaking out on his toxicity. I'm wrong when I'm present but right once I'm gone; it never fails. After that I really began to loose hope in life. Which is when the biggest change had ever occurred. I started to slowly become social but only once I really lost hope. At that point I'd all but given up on work, I wanted to finally make friends and connections, hoping to get some for better jobs. I got close until a motorcycle accident caused me to go insane; social judgment and dispossession followed as a result. People still have the audacity to simply say, ""get over it"". Must be comfortable and nice not living in my shoes.  In that year I had my first date, first social group, and even my first kiss. The nature of my life, heaven only came in small slices, never in full. Fantasies never helped, they'd only gotten in the way really.

Being unsocialized for so long made it next to impossible for me to find a group of people like myself driven towards things because they're inspiring, not for a source of ego or self-importance. Not that my low socioeconomic status helped me any in such a fragmented society as America. This being said, I did learn a lot about human behavior; from both my behaviors and the behaviors of others. It seems as if people, who've succumbed and settled on a toxic job, one that doesn't fit them, it motivates them to seek a soul in other places, meaning a social structure of similar faces and habits. Anybody like us in such an environment, where people seek a soul in people and not things. Better yet, not a balanced motivation, it's not a healthy situation. People then seek pleasure to run from what they resent, to justify the monotony of work. When I was younger, I chose to find work that brought a soul to my life, something that drove me. Not just a task to do simply for a paycheck. I couldn't do it, and I was very correct on how I'd react to such a setting. Just made me more of a consumer to burry the void and far more socially recluse as a result.

Please, no recommendations on workplaces, unless you're directly tied to aviation. I have very good insight into that environment and need no enlightenment about it. People don't care about you, your dreams, your desires, your problems. Least of all, they don't care about any shortcomings you may have. That's the nature of working in America as it currently stands. If I'd had any of my knowledge in the past, I'd have picked a place and stuck with it. Reality of it was, if I wasn't social and completely dispossessed, I'd have never understood what was in my way, both mentally and physically. Hell, I wouldn't even know who I am. Let go of idealistic states but never give up on what brings a source of breath to your life. Never allow people to come in-between you and a sought place or state of being, and never be reliant on people, they'll fail you. Most importantly, never grow comfortable in settling. Work should never be a place where people connect. In all honesty, that should've been what led them there in the first place. Social hives and workplaces aren't healthy, it breeds cliques and unity in suffering. A lot about modern life needs changing. Worst part I've seen, people whom believe they need no help need it the most. But they're sure quick to tell others 'like us' to get help.

325,I need help reconciling my Asperger‚Äôs diagnosis with my daily life.,"['asperger', 'reconciling', 'diagnosis', 'daily', 'life']","I (26 F) was recently diagnosed with Asperger‚Äôs along with inattentive ADHD. I understand the ADHD as that is what I was initially undergoing an assessment for and I can see very clearly where and how this effects my daily life however, along the course of the assessment, it became clear to my care professional that I also presented with Asperger‚Äôs mostly due to my social difficulties, sensory processing issues and my communication skills (or lack thereof) as well as not necessarily caring about things/people that would be considered ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.

I am having trouble reconciling this diagnosis. I think because I don‚Äôt see these issues as issues and more just how I‚Äôve lived my entire life. I think I need to be shown how very specific things I do are because of my Asperger‚Äôs eg. the way I do not like new colleagues when they are introduced to me, not because I dislike them personally, but because they introduce a new dynamic to my work place and disrupt the environment. I often dislike them until they have been around long enough to be considered part of what I would expect when I go to work.

Would anyone else be able to give examples of things they do/deal with daily that are a direct results of their Asperger‚Äôs? I am hoping this will help me pin point things I do that are a symptom so I can better understand it. 

My ADHD also makes this hard because it makes some things very contradicting. Eg, I dislike new colleagues but they often do not know that because I will most likely talk non stop to them due to my social impulsivity (ADHD) while simultaneously not being interested in anything about them nor engaging with actual back and forth conversation, just telling them about myself and things I like.

Anyone else","['cleanliness', 'nts', 'annoyed', 'ideas', 'slowly']","I might sound very petty, but let me explain: for a year now, I've been renting a flat/dorm mix. It's a small apartment in a complex. Normal concrete walls and a weird laminated, plastic like ground and of course a standard small bathroom.

Now, I will not lie I have some problems with cleaning. In the way I don't not do it, but that chaos just tends to build around me sometimes. I will clean in ""pushes"" as I can't really have a routine. I tried. But it doesn't work. Still, I keep things clean, I open the windows for sun and light every day and there are no bugs crawling around. 

Enter NT janitor. The janitor has seen my flat in 3 instances. One, where I was still not don't moving in due to complications, so obv. it looked cramped. Second was when he decided to check the stoves so he could potentially dismantle some old ones. He arrived at 10am in the morning, without prior warning and obv. the kitchen was cramped with dishes, as I had not yet done dishes for a day (very small kitchen). And another was today. 

My shower was clogged. I tried to clear it myself, but nothing worked. So I informed the janitor and started cleaning up. No dishes in the sink, bathroom completely spotless and aired, hiding everything potentially embarrassing. In the end, it was a normal normal flat. There were some things lying around, but I figured it didn't have to be perfect. Especially since he came in with outside shoes. 

He comes in and immediately starts to complain. How it's the ""dirtiest room he's ever seen in 18years of being a janitor"". That was an extreme statement, so I apologized and -truthfully- said I couldn't deep clean, due to papers being due. He says that's nonsense, because every time he's been here, it's the same. Then goes to unclogg the shower. Doesn't really know why it clogged, but it's free. Then turns around and again reprimands me for being ""dirty"". I try to explain I clean in pushes, but he cuts me right of and says I'm simply making excuses and to be aware I could be fined when moving out etc.

Again. I swear to God this is not a Neckbeard's nest. Whatever you might expect is NOT here. No flying underwear, no open pizza boxes or condoms or whatever. I'm already trying to be so clean. I just got a lot of stuff, so it looks messy on first glance. Show up when I cleaned then!

340,Strategies on how to be comfortable at a Family Event?,"['family', 'comfortable', 'event', 'strategies']","Need some tips on how to stay level-minded at my Niece‚Äôs 4th birthday, an event that I can‚Äôt possibly make an excuse for not going. Let me explain something about myself you see I‚Äôm one of those camouflage aspies where I can be 100% social and engage with anybody at a place (I try not to think it‚Äôs learned masking) and I do have G.A.D. but mine works differently where instead of not wanting to talk to anyone I like being friendly but get drained after being exposed too long and to all sorts of personalities to the point where I isolate myself out of the blue and need to recover days after. 

Now that I‚Äôve added some context let me explain the negative repercussions from spending time at these social gatherings. My oldest (half) sister is a great event planner with holidays/birthdays with preset schedules and activities and I‚Äôve had genuine fun spending time with her and her father‚Äôs side but it‚Äôs not enough to deal with the rest of the crowd there. She‚Äôs a bit of a normie so she obviously draws a crowd like that (not going to use NT because it‚Äôs thrown around plus I don‚Äôt know crap about their personal lives). While I can play the part well I simply get bored/dulled out by the majority since it‚Äôs that problem with how I perceive differently (as I‚Äôm told) and they can‚Äôt get on the same page or they just surround themselves with superficial things not in any way suitable for me (think of those WASP kinds of people). It also doesn‚Äôt help that some of girls there can‚Äôt keep their eyes off me (sorry I don‚Äôt want to come off as a bragger) even though they‚Äôre with their partners AND I‚Äôm the main leader‚Äôs brother for goodness sake like they can‚Äôt control themselves. The last time I went there one of her bf‚Äôs relatives was being a prick to me and didn‚Äôt even have the decency to be apologetic so I blew up in his face vocally and guess what, all the people acted like I was nonexistent even though I was steaming right next to them and was really about to walk home without saying goodbye. Couldn‚Äôt help but think they were fake and that no one cares if someone gets hurt at these kinds of things. My sister noticed and made me feel better which I thank her for having that sort of people skill.

Now the second issue is my mom wants to bring along her new bf, and I still haven‚Äôt made contact with him but he does seem like a positive reinforcement for her I guess but I‚Äôm just a son that‚Äôs been tired of her bf habits in the past especially since they were shitty to her so I‚Äôm keeping to my own life. Now I have to accompany him to my sister‚Äôs combined with the first issue. I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm just not a fan of these scenarios that seem forced socially and yes I hate relationships that have to involve meeting more people (this ain‚Äôt gonna be the Brady Bunch). I simply don‚Äôt like replacement or going along with another‚Äôs agendas. Hell I went as far as thinking to show up before him and mom and act like I‚Äôm someone else there hehe. 

So in simple terms I‚Äôm not a social butterfly I‚Äôm gonna stick to my introvert ways, possibly this time around stay to one room so I don‚Äôt spread myself thin and save my talking for engaging chatter or when I have to speak. Any tips would be appreciated. In my heart I genuinely want to be there for family.",wmw0hr,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wmw0hr/strategies_on_how_to_be_comfortable_at_a_family/

I don't have any friends. None. Haven't talked to any real person for the last two years. I've convinced myself that this is how I like it, but I don't. I just can't talk to people. It's like playing mental chess.

349,Hardest Part of being Autistic?,"['autistic', 'hardest']","I wasn't professionally diagnosed until this year and I've begun to reframe the way others have treated me in the past. Doing so has made me realize that 99% of people whom I thought were giving me the time of day were actually taking advantage of me. 

The hardest part for me right now is accepting I will never get closure with most/all of these people. Before knowing I was autistic, people I thought were my friends would suddenly drop and ghost me. I'd be left with so much confusion without any explanation. Now that I'm aware of my disability, I have been asking for accommodations from family and my (ex) partner. 

I ended up going no-contact with my abusive family, so no closure there, and my partner of nearly 10 years broke up with me as soon as I started standing up for myself. I'm not getting any closure there either as he has already moved on (was cheating on me the whole time actually) and has no interest in talking to me, definitely not about disability or his manipulative actions.

When I didn't know I was autistic I suffered constant heartache and bullying I couldn't process until now. And since I've started working on my self-esteem and standing up for myself, setting boundaries, and pointing out abusive behavior I've lost every last social support.

Again, the worst part is not having any closure. These people's actions are baffling, and I can't move on with things that don't make sense. What's worse, I know that these people don't think they've done anything wrong, and most probably haven't thought of me since I stopped being useful to them. 

Every day I'm hit with realization after realization that I was being manipulated, bullied, abused.

IMO the Sith were good guys, and the Jedi was bad guys. Like it or not,  Darth Vader provided jobs, gave an economic structure to many areas and addressed some issues some unheard had. What did the other side do? 

With all the space wizards saying they were for peace, did any of them  try to solve food problems, lack of income, no upward movement, and so  on? 

&#x200B;

Like while most view Star Fleet in Star Trek as good guys. But in reality they are bad. They exploit cultures, worlds, uproot people from their home without their say, they go after groups that want to leave, the group uses sudo slaves in making a given world just for x (farming, mining, etc) and making it near impossible for them to leave unless they join as an officer, and so on. But in return, they have a society that doesn't use money, they centralized technology and in this making it easier to make new and better technology, they protect many areas, and so on.

&#x200B;

Then if you look at smaller scale things like spiderman bad guys. Most of them are trying to get money to save someone they love or whatever. Much of it is caused by a corrupt gov and healthcare system that the average person has no way of paying for without going into a life a debt and slavery for 1 treatment. God forbid if there is another sickness. But all while spiderman is basically killing the kid and preventing them from getting better.

I‚Äôve been at this job for half a year now, and the first two months we got along great, and had some fun conversations. I noticed that around 2-3 months, their demeanor started to change towards me.  This coworker was in fact the main one training me in the new job. 

Well I began to notice this change when I made a mistake on something, likely do to my inattentiveness (I have moderate adhd). She seemed to become more cold that day, and would have days afterwards where she was in between. I never knew what day she would seem more talkative and bubbly towards me, but it certainly diminished over time. Now she never talks to me other than to ask work questions, yet whenever someone else comes in the room she is back to her loud gregarious self. 

Even when I ask her questions, I can barely hear her sometimes because she mutters words, and it seems like substantial effort for her to even want to talk to me. I‚Äôm not asking to be friends with this person to make it clear, but the difference in how she acts towards me verse others is quite noticeable. My concern more lays in the fact that I don‚Äôt know what I did to make her behavior change. Was it that she was tired of training me and my mistakes were getting old? That we don‚Äôt have a lot in common? Did I say something to upset her? I‚Äôm completely clueless, and maybe I‚Äôm reading into this too much.

But I'm the only adult I know, that collects, enjoys the things I do. Except from my close friend who got a little bit influenced by me XD However I would not consider most of what I have, for children! With the price tag on some of the things most would not let children use them as playthings. But anyone not familiar with my interests and hobbies would probably consider it childish, even mistake it for childrens toys.

I don't have my room stuffed with things as I try to not cross the line for what would be considered too much or even hoarding. I try to keep things a bit more minimalistic but still have the things that matters the most to me.

I have a collection of dolls. Or BJDs, ball jointed dolls as they are called. That's the expensive part of my hobby, and the part that takes me longest to save up for. They are like amazing art dolls made of resin.  Some are anime styled, some stylized, some inbetween stylized and realistic, and some even realistic looking.  But I also have som Blythes, Pullips and  Pure Nemos.

I'm really into Chinese Ancient Drama and Danmei, so currently I'm in the process of getting some of my BJDs Chinese Hanfu outfits and ancient styled hairstyles. That intersts started with some art I saw, then the live drama ""The Untamed"", and now I'm reading the novel that The Untamed is based on. And waiting for the first volume of my Mo Dao zu Shi ""Manhua"", comic book pre-order.

I never got into the Nendoroids, however the Nendoroid Dolls feel more like anime dolls so I have a few of them.

I'm thinking of getting a large plush Stitch doll next. ""Stitch"" from Lilo and Stitch. Something about this plushie just spoke to me. He's an alien, I'm an alien jadajadajah so, XD

Besides my dolls and few plushies I have some spirithoods and tails hanging on the wall. Not a Furry btw, I'm not in that community nor do I have much interest in things like that. It's another reason for that though. Same as I'm really into my zodic sign ""Capricorn"" and wish to purchase a Capricorn inspired spirithood oneday.

Then there's a shelf with crystals and tarot and oracle cards.

And last I love playing games on my Switch. Mainly farming/ building/ adventure games. Some visual novels, and some older style RPGs.

But honestly, I don't understand why these things have to be considered childish though... I just think people take life too seriously, thinking that when you reach a certain age you can't enjoy certain things anymore.

- Trying to take things slow and break down social interactions into small, manageable steps. For example, if you're feeling overwhelmed by a big group conversation, start by trying to engage in smaller conversations with just one or two people first. 
- Practicing what you want to say before actually saying it out loud. This can help you feel more prepared and confident when engaging in social situations. 
- Listening more than you talk. Not only will this help you learn more about the people around you, but it can also make others perceive you as being a good listener - always a valuable quality in any social interaction! 
- Don't be afraid to ask for help from loved ones or professionals if needed.

I thought it was ADHD. I thought it was OCD. I thought it was my depression and anxiety.

I feel disappointed in this diagnosis I think... although it certainly does makes sense. My therapist said that the more research I do, the more puzzle pieces will begin to slide into place. I'll suddenly remember an event, she said, and realize exactly why I reacted the way I did. And I have actually.

But this isn't something curable. I have been barely functioning as is and what I was looking for was a fix. This isn't fixable. I feel like I'm back at square one and hopeless. I'll have to keep struggling to be normal until the day I die and I'm so tired of it.

I guess I just don't know what part of me is the autism and what part of me is my trauma and what part of me is all of the other potential things that are wrong with me. Is my inability to clean my house the autism? How about how I can never finish a project even if I want to and even if I love it? Is it why I'm exhausted at the end of the day?

385,I keep thinking about how I was ALMOST diagnosed with autism,"['autism', 'diagnosed', 'thinking']","I'm undiagnosed so I don't know if this post belongs here, but when I talk to my friends about this they just don't get it (the neurotypical ones obviously don't, but even some of my friends with asperger's/autism are people in western countries and the dynamic is so different in India)

From what my mother has told me: I was 2.5 years old and wasn't speaking properly by that age. This was late 00s India, so when some doctor told my parents it might be autism, they apparently just ignored that? A friend told them to go to a paediatrician, so they did. That guy just said to put me in a pre-school (and apparently also said that, ""kids like these have good musical ability"", not that he gave any reason, and not that my parents asked him to explain himself because they're dumbasses). Then I started speaking a little more functionally (mind you, I'm still semi-verbal and frequently find myself unable to speak at all, it's *not* voluntary, a combination of physical chronic pain and *something else that I don't understand* renders me mute or semi-mute all the goddamn time).

They avoided a diagnosis because they were influenced by the stigma around autism, and apparently the doctor mentioned getting an MRI and *according to my mother*, ""MRIs have radiation so it would be really harmful for a young child's health!"" (the radiation bit is false, not that my mother cares)

SO HEY I'm definitely neurotypical, according to them! EXCEPT FOR THE SUPER OBVIOUS PROBLEMS, here's a taste of them: 

All my life I've had problems with lights being too bright for me when they just seemed normal to everyone else. And certain textures (wearing denim & eating eggs are the worst) being so intensely gross. Getting overwhelmed by sound and lights too easily. ""Fidgeting"" and waving my hands around and being asked to stop even though I can't process my thoughts or talk without doing that (thankfully people have started caring less because I'm more confident now, since I've embraced being an eccentric person). Not understanding social cues and being manipulated due to my lack of social skills (before I learned better). Eye contact is like staring into the sun. I get fixated on some very specific things (music/music theory, space, physics, politics, certain, media) for hours and hours on end and forget to eat and often end up barely being able to talk about anything besides the very specific topics I'm interested in at a given moment, and it's a STRUGGLE to not speak monotone by default, and--

I could go on. I could go on and on and on. Some of my resentment *does* come from struggles caused by my physical health issues (which my parents neglected for 4 years, and then it took 2 more years after that to give me treatment that *doesn't* involve pseudoscientific quackery; at best I can leave the house for school and otherwise for 1.5 hour intervals and everything else is pain, for a long time I dissociated 24/7 due to sensory overload until I figured out my own methods to cope and even then it fucking sucks). But basically, EVERYTHING IS DIFFICULT, everything is a struggle because EXISTING is a struggle and I'm 17 and can't do half the things my peers can, IT'S ISOLATING AND ALIENATING.

I have no clue if getting an autism diagnosis would be of any use. I haven't heard much about how an adult goes about getting a diagnosis in India (since I wouldn't even try till I'm far, far away from my parents; I've got several other very severe problems too, mental health ones especially, and they're more pressing than the suspected autism, and you can bet I won't tell my parents if I get diagnosed because I expect them to attempt manipulation). I don't even know if I'll *try* getting a diagnosis at all (again, more concerning/high-priority things I need to take care of once I'm an adult). Maybe I just needed to vent because I'm angry.

I told the DM I have Asperger's and he just seems to have not gotten it. He gave no help, no advice, no nothing, just told me to stop.

He and the players who complained just don't seem to understand how hard it is for me to change a behavior without help, and it hurts that they just cut me off like that.

396,Family hid diagnosis for 27 years.,"['diagnosis', 'hid', 'family', 'years', '27']","I've written and deleted this so many times over the past few days, still not sure if I should post this or not.

Over this past weekend my family had a get together, most of them I have not seen in over a decade, some longer even. I have been planning on asking questions about my belief that I could possibly be autistic, for the weeks leading up to this I wrote down questions and rewrote and edited everything I planned to ask even asking my partner how to make things more subtle but direct enough that I could at least get the answers. The plan did not survive contact with my family.

Too many new faces and old faces that have changed, I completely blanked and went back into my old mode of trying to not be noticed. My partner would have none of it though. She dragged me off to see my grandfather who does not have long left, stage 4 cancer has changed him so much. 

It was as awkward as you can imagine, somewhere in the conversation he said ""I see you haven't grown out of the shyness yet, the doctors said you wouldn't"". I didn't really know what to respond besides asking which doctors.

I remember having to go to speech therapy and some behavioral therapy in the first year of school so that I could be 'on the same level' as my other class mates as I was younger than the rest of my peers as my birthday falls in the last part of the school year and generally those kids have to get evaluated or kept back a year. This was partially correct. Early the previous year (1994) I was evaluated to go to school and they picked up something, I was then referred to a specialist who then diagnosed me with Asperger's Syndrome (yes I know it is no longer called that, this is as it was told to me by my grandfather and later corroborated by other family and eventually my father when I confronted him), also with ADHD and Dyslexia.

My grandfather and grandmother were told that I had grown out of it and they were never to mention it, neither knew much and just figured it was another illness their constantly sick grandchildren had. My younger brother and I were in and out of hospital for various issues and hereditary faults so my parents were constantly stressed and in a lot of debt so once I seemed to have 'gotten better' they dropped the therapy and pretended that I had been cured. Yes this was a shock and made me angry. Here I was 27 years later at 33 looking for answers as to why my life was the way it was, I had come to find answers of sorts in RAAD-S, AQ, AQ-10, Aspie Quiz, etc. I had found answers in this community and others. None of the answers were official and I have been in and out of impostor syndrome while I kept looking more and more into it, spiraling and letting my work and relationship suffer as I delved deeper into Autism research and looking for someone in this backwards country to help me. Meantime my family had the answer, an official one. This was not the end though.

&#x200B;

I sought out conformation, my grandfather was old, sick, and gave no fucks. He could have been wrong. I directly spoke to my aunts and uncles. They hesitated at first and then confirmed that yes, I was diagnosed with Aspergers (Assburgers for some or that I was ""r-word once""). I was livid and turned to the one person responsible for me not knowing myself, for me not getting the help and support I need. My father.

&#x200B;

He confirmed it. It looked like I had 'gotten better', so they had stopped the therapy, they were scared I was going to be taken away so they had decided to pretend that I had never been diagnosed at all. Whenever the school came to them with sorry that I was different they covered it by reminding the school that I was younger than my peers and just had to catch up. 

My mother died suddenly in 1998. I remember it clearly, what followed not so much as I had retracted into myself and became almost nonverbal. I remember lots of different therapists. My dad told me that they all suspected Aspergers and wanted me referred for diagnosis, one even wanted to diagnose him. He moved me around in fear that I would be diagnosed again and taken away from him and put in a home. He could not have that, eventually he found someone that looked at money rather than the patient and I became a kid who was grief-stricken.

Time went on and I had many issues with learning and fitting in, at no time was my diagnosis disclosed, I was just shy and lazy and 'smart but does not want to put in the work'.

He never realised what Aspergers was or what I have been dealing with, he was too scared to lose me.

It has taken the last few days for me to overcome the anger, in my delving into Autism I have been suspecting that my father is also autistic, he was trying to do the best he could, it wasn't great and it wasn't always the right thing but he was suddenly alone and had 3 kids to take care of, 2 of whom were very sick physically. In some parts I blame him for never telling me, in others I sort of understand in an odd way.

&#x200B;

I am no longer just the weird guy, I am no longer a freak, I am no longer looking for a diagnosis or self diagnosing, I am an Aspie. In my country there are no accommodations and very little support for adults and it is ok, all I ever wanted was to know why I was broken. Now, finally I know I am not broken, just different. The relief of finally knowing is something I can not describe. I just wish it had come sooner, before the suicide attempts and burnouts, before all the jobs I lost and walked out on, I wish I had known who I was sooner. On the other hand I can't change the past, at least now I know that I am not crazy or a freak.

Person B: ""Yeah but you killed my father too...""

Option 1: We are even then, \*Proceeding to drink beer\*

Option 2: They sue each other's ass of OR start a physical fight.

The reason I ask this is, whenever I point out some really crap behavior to people (family members mostly) and criticize them, they say: ""well you do similar stuff too"" (may also be a lie but for the sake of argument I assume here that I actually did).

It always seemed a bit weird to me. Many people seem to think this way. Even some justice systems believe that two equal crimes cancel each other out. Or the religious stuff in Abrahamic religions (an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and the resulting semi-legality of retaliation outside of the justice system).

I personally don't get at all how one crappy behavior on one person's side in the past magically justifies a similar (or vaguely similar) crappy behavior of another person in the present. It makes literally ZERO sense to me. Crappy behavior is never really ok and justified, and while there are halfway legit ways to justify it (like illness, stress, being in the middle of a major tragedy, misjudgment of the situation or thinking error, severe financial trouble, fear for ones life etc.), this way of justifying really makes no sense at all.

408,What is friendship to you?,['friendship'],"I had ""friends"" for years. A few came, a few left, some stayed the same since childhood. I thought it was ok. We hanged out, played games together, sometimes went to trips. Stuff like that.

Turns out there was never any meaningful connection between us. The only thing we have in common is what we hanged out together for so long already (and the differences are just compounding as each year passes). I also learned that if you trust someone and allow yourself to be vulnerable they can really devastate you and destroy your phsyche.

It hurt extremely and it damaged my ability to trust or feel safe around others (still not fixed), but it also taught me that just because I considered them as important as my own life doesn't mean they cared about me the same way.

So trusting people with whom I had a long history with, to care when I need to be vulnerable and show pain was stupid. Turns out half of them couldn't care less and the other half put their political views before my lived experiences and not just dismissed what I was dealing with but made it worse.

I need meaningfull human contact. I need someone I can trust and feel safe with, to have some moments in my life when I can forget about all the crap the world brings and just relax for a moment or to be vulnerable with when the pain is too much. To know that even if they don't share concerns over the same things that affect my life they won't dismiss my problems because their political ideology says they're not real.

But I figure that's not what a friend is because everywhere I look around me it just seems to be this utterly superficial connection where people kinda tolerate each other. The people I hang out with (and used to call friends) at times barely tolerate each other, at most they play games together. My mother's friends are people with vastly incompatible values that she tolerates so that she has someone to talk to and she absolutely talks over them when she is with them because she is not interested in understanding them in the slightest. My dad openly admits that there is only one person in his life who he would consider a close friend, everything else is better described as superficial (including my mother).

I feel like maybe I have an extremely unrealistic view of what to hope for in a friend and that all people really have is superficial nothingness that shows how little it cares about you the moment they encounter something they don't understand.

If you have had many interview rejections, have you been able to discover where you were going wrong? If so, I would like to hear from you because it might help me to improve my situation. I have no idea where to begin. I can only guess.

Some things that come to mind are:

* Being too specific and detailed in my answers
* Showing frustration about processes and procedures from past employers
* Focusing too much in one area
* Having to get everything out (everything that I am thinking)
* Being too honest about how I feel about some ways of doing things
* Being too blunt

415,My long autism story short,"['autism', 'story', 'short', 'long']","In my family, this silence arose as a consequence of trauma. My grandmother's brother seems to have been ""fetched"" in WWII, that's how they talk about it in Austria. ""Fetched"", that is, he was, for example, torn out of school and k*ll*d. All those who experienced the 2nd World War kept silent. We never talked about the war.

I went in search of my ancestors, because from puberty I felt that something was wrong. This silence of my family was unbearable for me.

I found a man with the last name of my ancestors. He was a local councillor and kept having dizzy spells. The newspaper said that he simply flew out of the window in the thirties. One suspects a vertigo attack. This is exactly the same thing that keeps happening to me, especially when I feel stress. So autism runs like a thread through my family history, but no one ever thought it was worth the trouble to make life easier for their family. Everyone kept quiet.

I passed on an ancient war trauma to my son, but when I realized who I really was in therapy (my therapist suspects Asperger's), I wanted to turn the tide. But we only have striking behaviors in our family in childhood. They almost completely disappear in adolescence, and don't come back until about 35. My son is 23, so don't take my word for it. By this time, he has no problems. My parents have been gaslighting me all my life anyway if I said something was wrong with us. If I told my mom, her ableist ass would start talking to me in baby talk.

So I live without diagnosis. In Austria there is no therapy, wheter you have or have not a diagnosis. I know autistic people with bachelor degree, and they are put in an institution for mentally disabled. She weaves baskets, but has an iq of 150. That can't be right. I tell it to my doctors, my husband and my son know about it, but no one else. My mother is ableist like hell, my autistic father and grandmother are dead. So there is no need to tell anyone.

How can I improve?","['mood', 'relationship', 'calm', 'partner', 'improve']","I'm AS and my partner is NT.  I've been told by her that because my demeanor is calm, silly, goofy, sweet, etc. most of the time, that when I get sad, angry, stressed, or generally upset, it's such a contrast to who I am.  I know this isn't just confined to people with Asperger's, but thought mentioning it might be worthwhile in case any NT has had similar experiences.

Below is an abbreviated account/example of what happened recently. I'm trying to remember all details, but I'm likely missing some elements and can fill them in if I remember (I know my partner had a different experience, and I want to do that justice).

While traveling together recently, I had a really bad morning of sadness hit me out of nowhere, and I needed to take time to myself in the hotel to figure out what might have been causing it.  

When my partner came back to the room, I believe I was focused on packing still and not really ""in-tune"" with her being there :/  I know, already, I become very quiet and ""fall inwards"" when I get sad or upset.

I still hadn't figured out what was bothering me, but told her I'm up for going on a walk now and to take photos of her.  She said she didn't want to because she didn't want to remember the moment, and that I looked noticeably miserable all over my face and the way I carried myself.  She also mentioned my sadness was starting to affect her.

This hurt and I really didn't want to keep affecting her, I said I would just go refill the rental car's gas and she said she would just pack.

When I came back, I finished packing and she did the same.  She was close to me and jokingly said, ""Trust fall!"" and gently collapsed onto me.  When she did, I said, ""No..."" because I truly didn't understand what was going on - just 15 minutes prior it felt like she had put up a wall.  I didn't think things could just change over that quickly (I can see now how she was trying to make the situation better).

Skipping ahead... she was very sad and started crying a lot.  My partner asked why I couldn't just comfort her, why I couldn't just make her feel better with a hug instead of being cold and distant (my words, not hers) and treating her like she wasn't even there.  She also said my misery was making her feel so miserable to the point she felt like breaking up with me.  

We worked our way out of that, but that is definitely an experience that hurt knowing I had such an affect on her.  

I want to do better, and am looking for any advice on how I can improve so I don't hurt her like this in the future :(",wl7zr3,4,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wl7zr3/those_in_an_asnt_relationship_is_your_as_partner/

I grew up in the state of Texas primarily, and in my high school years I met Michelle. We always knew Michelle as being a little bit different than the rest of us, but in the late 80s we had no idea what autism was or any type of spectrum condition. Her parents completely shunned her, she never was able to pass her driver‚Äôs test or get a job. And back then, there was no such thing as disability, especially not for anything like Asperger‚Äôs.

I only found out about her diagnosis probably like eight years ago. Before that I just assumed she was a little quirky. She used to have these panic attacks for what she took Xanax. Back then, no one really understood what panic attacks were, nor did we understand the extreme and dire dangers of benzodiazepines. Believe me I‚Äôve been on one for 10 years and it is pretty much ruined my brain.

Anyway, she had no place to go so she was my roommate when we were both around 19 or 20. She was an amazing artist and singer and we had such a good time together. And then at some point she had to leave and I‚Äôm not really sure where she went. I know she got involved in drinking probably to drown out the feelings that she was having.

I was driving with my boyfriend a long time ago on lower Greenville a street residing in Dallas, Texas. I saw her walking along the street with a bottle of alcohol in her hand. I called mutual friend of ours and she said that she lived with some people in the apartment complex, namely some really strange men. She had no where to go and no way to take care of herself. I have a feeling people took advantage of her.‚Ä¶

At that time in the late 80s or early 90s, and especially in the south, autism was not recognized in women, much less men. None of us really knew, especially her family.  I have a feeling if she was born now, she would‚Äôve been diagnosed and helped, and had more support from communities like this, but Reddit did not exist back then much less the Internet. I often think of her, and she was primarily forgotten by her friends and family. Only a few of us remember her. I don‚Äôt know why I feel compelled to post this on this forum, but I‚Äôd like everyone to think of people in the past who had no resources and were left to their own devices to figure out who they were with absolutely no support.

Although I know it can be a struggle for money, just be thankful that there are some resources out there for people. Take a second to think about people back in the day who had undiagnosed Asperger‚Äòs or autism and the struggles they suffered. I wish we would have known.

I have a grainy video of her singing at a talent show at our high school, but this form does not allow links. I‚Äôve been looking at some pictures of her as well. She had bright red hair, alabaster skin and a very nice figure. I used to sit for her and she would draw chalk pictures of me and sing songs and dance in our living room. Anyway that‚Äôs all I have to really say.

446,University of Cambridge research: Autistic individuals are more likely to be LGBTQ+,"['lgbtq', 'autistic', 'individuals', 'research', 'cambridge']","https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-individuals-are-more-likely-to-be-lgbtq

‚ÄúNew research from the University of Cambridge suggests that autistic individuals are less likely to identify as heterosexual and more likely to identify with a diverse range of sexual orientations than non-autistic individuals.

The findings have important implications for the healthcare and support of autistic individuals. The results are published in the journal Autism Research.  

For many years it was wrongly assumed that autistic individuals are uninterested in sexual or romantic relationships, but this is not the case. In recent years, small studies have suggested that autistic individuals are more likely to experience a wider diversity of sexual orientations and are less likely to have sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, the existing evidence has been limited in size and scope.

In the largest study to date on these topics, the team at the Autism Research Centre used an anonymous, self-report survey to study the sexual activity, sexual orientation, and sexual health of autistic adults. Overall, 1,183 autistic and 1,203 non-autistic adolescents and adults (aged 16-90 years) provided information about their sexual activity, sexual orientation, and medical history of STIs.

The results showed that the majority of autistic adults (70% of autistic males and 76% of autistic females) engage in sexual activity‚Äîalthough they do so to a lesser degree than their non-autistic peers (89% of both non-autistic males and females report engaging in sexual activity). In contrast to previous findings, the results also found that there were no differences in likelihood of ever contracting an STI, or the age at which participants first engaged in sexual activity, between autistic and non-autistic individuals.

In addition, the study found that autistic adults and adolescents are approximately eight times more likely to identify as asexual and ‚Äòother‚Äô sexuality than their non-autistic peers. And there were sex differences in sexual orientation: **autistic males are 3.5 times more likely to identify as bisexual than non-autistic males, whereas autistic females are three times more likely to identify as homosexual than non-autistic females.**

When comparing autistic females and males directly, autistic females were more likely to be sexually active; more likely to identify as asexual, bisexual, and ‚Äòother‚Äô sexuality; and were less likely to identify as heterosexual.

Elizabeth Weir, a PhD candidate at the Autism Research Centre in Cambridge, and the lead researcher of the study, said: ‚ÄúUnderstanding the intersectional identities of autistic individuals who are asexual, bisexual, homosexual, or ‚Äòother‚Äô sexuality is key. It is particularly important that healthcare providers and educators use language that is affirming and accepting of all sexual orientations and gender identities when providing sexual education and sexual health screening checks to autistic and non-autistic people alike.‚Äù 

Dr Carrie Allison, Director of Strategy at the Autism Research Centre and a member of the team, said: ‚ÄúWe must ensure that autistic individuals are receiving equal access to healthcare and support in their choices in their personal lives, to enjoy fulfilling lives and good mental health.‚Äù

Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, Director of the Autism Research Centre and a member of the team, said: ‚ÄúThis new study is an important example of applied health research with policy relevance for health and social care services.‚Äù",wkemwz,105,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wkemwz/university_of_cambridge_research_autistic/

448,Life problems from under stimulation? Is it ADHD? What is my deal??,"['adhd', 'stimulation', 'problems', 'life', 'deal']","Hey y‚Äôall, 

I don‚Äôt know where to begin with this so let me start here: I‚Äôm definitely Asperger‚Äôs/ASD. I was diagnosed as a child, 100% fit all the criteria, very certain of it. However, I got diagnosed with ADHD by my psych close to two years ago, while I was in grad school. I have tried all the ADHD stimulants many, many times in the intervening period and could not get myself to stay on any single one of them, often not even for a week. They benefited me in terms of work and staying on track with things I didn‚Äôt wanna do, but they also caused me problems like anxiety and insomnia. This was all very tough to deal with in addition to a bad set of life circumstances in my PhD program, so I quit the program and left. This was largely the end of me even thinking about ADHD.

However, in the intervening months, I‚Äôve been working a summer job that is very, very boring. It‚Äôs not at all what I want to do for my career, but I needed something as a transition after grad school and I went with it. It‚Äôs a fairy typical 8-5 full time office job.

However, even though I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be the most fun thing ever, I also have been really, really surprised at how badly I‚Äôve handled it. I have been absolutely miserable here. I become so, so, so bored every single day at work that I can barely sit still. I become very restless. I become glued to my phone but even that gets boring quick. Above all, my brain starts ABSOLUTELY SCREAMING AT ME to do ANYTHING to make a change. I‚Äôve tried all sorts of meds and strategies in the last couple months of the job, but only the Concerta I‚Äôve taken this week has given me any sort of relief from this feeling at all. And I‚Äôm honestly STILL bored.

I know for sure some of this misery comes from life circumstances. I‚Äôm in a sucky lil spot of my life rn and that‚Äôs fine. But I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have THIS difficult of a time handling a job like this and it honestly is making me rethink whether or not I need stimulant meds.

The problem, tho, is that I am very, very averse to taking pharmaceutical psychiatric meds unless I feel like I have to (I kinda fear them). I also, largely, don‚Äôt present like any ‚Äútypical‚Äù ADHD person I know; I was very, very good at school for example. And my friends and family have at times expressed doubt as well.

But Concerta has been THE only thing that relieves this intense feeling of‚Ä¶understimulation? Is this ADHD and I‚Äôm just presenting differently? What is my deal??

Trip planning? Research and document everything in GDoc, including TripAdvisor ratings of each points of interest.  Want to watch movies during a 16-hr flight?  Let‚Äôs look up their ratings, type them in Notes, then pick from there.

I always thought this over-complicated things which stresses him out even more ‚Äîhaving to do so much research even on simple stuff, and documenting them.  Why not just pick a random movie from the flight‚Äôs entertainment system that seems interesting, instead of nagging me to look up movie ratings before we take off?

I know he told me that for trips, it does give him anxiety if we don‚Äôt document trip details, which is understandable.  But how about the simple stuff? Does this also help with anxiety?

I would like to understand because he has expressed that he would like to reduce things that are giving him stress (and less things to think about = less anxiety).. and he wants me to help him..but the way he does things is complicated and stressful in itself

My wife when we had been together for about a year sat me down and asked me if I thought I might be on the spectrum. I of course had an immediate reaction and got upset. No idea why, other than I had never had _any_ experience with mental health help or issues. This was about 7 years ago.

Got an evaluation. I was in the mindset that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm an autist‚Äù. All of my eval scores put me as ‚Äúhigh functioning autism‚Äù and a diagnosis of ADHD (100% have ADHD). Got meds, life changed for the positive.

2-3 years later I really started to understand how the amphetamines affected me. At first it just let me break out of thinking loops and decision paralysis. Which was truly just remarkable. Then I started to realized no matter what, sometimes I just could not function. Like having a whole body and brain hangover for days, or weeks at a time.

Started with  a new therapist to address my often surprising aggression and anger. I would (have always) snapped at people for really strange reasons. Not loading the dishwasher the right way. Not sorting the recycling. Not feeling heard, or people not understanding the point I‚Äôm making. Being told I‚Äôm mean/rude. Therapist suggested anger management, I played along and some of it helped. It was ultimately treating a symptom.

Second therapist, couples counseling. Same issues. It‚Äôs starting to really negatively impact my marriage. I stop drinking, commit to bi-weekly therapy. Still the same. It‚Äôs not even on my radar that I might be on the spectrum. Therapist doesn‚Äôt appear to feel it either. This engagement ends up being years of feel good talking. Which is really nice. It‚Äôs effectively an emotional massage though.

Snap to present time. New psychiatrist. Reporting to him extreme fatigue, depression, hopelessness. At this point I feel like I‚Äôm just not part of this world. I feel most normal by myself at night, tinkering in the shop or playing video games. Playing with my kiddo, riding my bike, hiking, or being outside. Otherwise it just feels alien. I have very recently come to this realization; I am on lexapro which has massively helped relieve the severity of fatigue and depression. It‚Äôs allowed me to acknowledge I feel these things.

Meanwhile my ENTIRE life I‚Äôve struggled with eye contact. I cannot sit still when I‚Äôm in a group (playing with hair, tapping, fidgeting with heavy things knives, tools, etc). Even stuttering in extremely difficult situations (job interviews, speaking to authority).

So here I am. 40 year old husband, father, respected professional in my field. I feel like I am those things to other people and myself when I‚Äôm alone. My wife has her own struggles but is supportive and kind about this. When I brought it up, she gave me a knowing smile I‚Äôve only seen a few times - last time was telling me she was pregnant.

I‚Äôm paralyzed, mentally. All I can think about is how do I understand who I am. How do I not pretend to be someone else?

466,How do you build a circle of friends with ASD + ADHD (+ problem with male/female friendships),"['asd', 'friendships', 'adhd', 'friends', 'circle']","Im very extroverted and need meaningful social interaction otherwise I'm very unhappy. Yet at the same time Ive lots of difficulties building relationships. I also didn't have any friendships in my youth and inexperience from that working against me. 

- I always need a context to socialize. 
- I don't reciprocate in the normal way, and often chitchat bores me. I like to be doing activities but sometimes people just want to chill. 
- I have a short attention span. I often jump from person to person, it's superficial and not bonding. 
- I don't know how to judge the character of someone. Have been abused in the past, sometimes I overreact, sometimes I am still too naive. Othertimes I am too 'idealistic' in how someone should behave. 
- I crave people I can be close too, but then there's always the risk of the person not really caring about you. Happens with male friends when they want sex. It's discouraging. Or they get too emotionally attached, or other times me. (I don't really want romance/dating, but close platonic friendships.)

I'm working on all these things, and it's not like Ive not built any relationships, but I notice these issues to varying degrees. Any tips you can share?

470,I can't carry a conversation for shit,"['conversation', 'carry', 'shit']","I am absolutely useless at initiating and carrying (ie. being the driving force of) a conversation. and it seems like no matter what I try it doesn't work.

leading a conversation is a distinction I have read in various online resources for improving your social skills. and it makes sense to me.

I've realised that when other people (ie. neutrotypicals) are talking to me, I can latch on to what they're saying and run with it. I can think of things to say back, put my own spin on what they've said, etc. and can appear very competent at socialising in general. but it's COMPLETELY dependent on the other person being the driving force. it's like the moon appearing to shine brightly when in fact it's merely reflecting the light of the sun. if the sun went out, the moon would be invisible.

if I'm ever in a situation where someone is taking the exact same passive attitude towards me, and waiting for me to set the agenda, set the topic, provide conversation for them to latch onto... I'm just hopeless. don't get me wrong, I try, but most of the time it just doesn't land at all. nothing in particular comes to mind and I'm just asking generic questions. occassionally I'll think of something about my life to share but it's a fleeting moment at best. I can't do that consistently. it's like I""m grasping at thin air.

it baffles me how neutrotypicals do this so effortlessly. the ability to take the lead effectively in a conversation seems impossible to me. it could be a matter of depression dampening my mood, something that many of us on the spectrum are prone to. but even when I'm not depressed, it's still an alien concept to me. and yet, it's clearly an important skill to have to get through day to day life.

does anyone have any resources that have helped them with this challenge?

473,Loneliness in Neurodiverse relationships - from a Neurotypical Partner,"['neurotypical', 'loneliness', 'relationships', 'neurodiverse', 'partner']","Hello! Before I post I just want to preface by saying I understand that everybody's relationship experiences are different, and in no way do I wish to offend anyone reading this post. 

I have been with my current girlfriend for two years now  (I am 21, she is 22), and in the past year or so we have been trying to find proper evaluation for adult autism, as we both believe she shows traits of high functioning autism. 

We had been long distance for a year before meeting her due to corona and although I noticed that she was perhaps a little more reserved and quirky than my previous partners, I cherished that she was always honest, had a great sense of humor, and did not play any mind games. She is the first person I genuinely loved and would walk through fire for. 

But once we met in person, a lot changed. She told me she felt like she would like to be my girlfriend instead (we were boyfriend-girlfriend previously) and whilst that did not change how much I loved and supported her, I started to see that she doesn't notice changes in my mood or the atmosphere in conversations. 

Previously, there were things that bothered me about the relationship and made me feel insecure- but every time I brought them up she apologized genuinely, and I forgave her. Some of the things were: she would not introduce me to any of her friends or family, when I have with mine. Calling me a rebound and unloading all of her worries to me during the early phases of our relationship. Never initiating conversations outside of her interests and her individual situations. Being unable to empathize with me when I opened up about my traumas.. bringing them up again and saying ""I'm sorry, I did not realize you were still impacted by it."" or ""Is there a reason you do not want to talk about it?""

Additionally, even when I try introducing her to my friends, she was not very interested in conversations with them, with my friends commenting that she seemed disinterested or ""cold"". My friends are polite and gentle towards her, and I had hoped she could be more interested in becoming their friends too. 

I am so sorry if this offends anyone. I know not everyone on the spectrum is like this but I am at my wits end trying to get my ""lover"" to care about me. I feel like I could cry in front of her and she would not say anything or continue talking about her special interest the next day without checking in on how I feel. I feel so hurt and confused. She says she loves me- but she does not bother to check in with me about.. anything. Everything feels so mechanic. 

and whats worse.. the past few months our relationship has been rocky as I continue to try to communicate how I feel- I tell her I feel lonely and would like to be taken out on a nice date every once in a while, or I feel like I'm just someone that exists next to her and it would be nice if she took more initiative to keep things fresh in the relationship.

When I share my feelings, she alters her behavior for a week or two but eventually starts to believe I do not accept her or I am somehow confusing her on my love for her.. 

I love her yes, but I if she just took one day, just one day to think about my feelings she would see how much I am trying to make her happy and she does not seem to reciprocate or care. 

We tried taking breaks and during those times she is colder to me than any friend I have. It's as if it does not matter to her if I am her girlfriend or not. I am just.. a thing in her life that can be molded into whatever she needs. 

I feel so lost and hurt and neglected.

483,(25M) Feeling like anyone even slightly more athletic than myself is automatically out of my league/not interested - how should I work on this?,"['athletic', '25m', 'league', 'slightly', 'feeling']","I hardly have any experience with dating and have never been in an actual relationship, and I feel like this might be one of the main reasons why. 

I'm not lazy or physically inactive by any means, but I wouldn't call myself super athletic either. I like going for walks, either around town with my dog, or preferably hikes out in nature (although I don't get to do that as often). I also do casual workouts from home and have a personal trainer, I mostly avoid going to public gyms due to social anxiety. And in the summer I like to swim as well.

I think I'm in pretty decent overall shape but I'm not really shredded and I have a bit of belly fat that I can't seem to get rid of - not like a massive beer gut or anything, but still enough for me to feel self conscious about (my personal trainer thinks it might actually be a side effect of the medication I'm on). I could never really get into team sports because of coordination and visual processing disabilities.

I really love nature, animals and the outdoors and I want a partner who shares the same values. I've noticed though that this generally tends to appeal to people who are more athletic than I am. Not absolutely everyone who likes the outdoors is really athletic, but I feel like most people are. But I have this feeling in my head that anyone who's even slightly more athletic than myself won't be interested because they'll want to be with someone who is as athletic (or more) than they are.

For instance a few years ago when I was at college I was interested in a girl in my class. We got along really well and had a lot in common. I had a couple of friends who were suggesting that I ask her out. And in hindsight she might have been showing signs of interest - I'm not really sure because I didn't pick up on them at the time, but I might have just been oblivious. But I became convinced that I wasn't good enough for her because she was into cross country skiing (something I haven't been able to do because of my coordination issues) and played soccer. I figured at the time she would see me as lazy for not being as athletic as her and would never be interested in a less athletic guy.

I kind of know in a part of my mind that this isn't completely rational. I've seen couples where one partner is more athletic than the other, I've posted selfies to other subreddits and had people say that I'm not in bad shape and at least one person called me ""cute"". And it's not even that I'm *only* into super athletic women either, as I said earlier it's the values and interests that I'm drawn to. It's just that those values tend to appeal to more athletic people.

I opened up to some people I know in real life about this and they thought I should talk to a therapist about this because it's not rational.

John was bullied into a state of total social confusion. The NT character he clashed with at the beginning of the movie, aimed to destroy him for humiliating his ego in the first scene. This character constructed a string of letters himself but marked as if they were from the CIA.  As a fellow scholar, he could make the letters sound authentic and he sent them to John Nash. He did this repeatedly, using a false address of an abandoned home nearby, to drive John down a rabbit hole that would ruin him and his reputation.

John Nash, thinking the letters were real, took this contact seriously and made it is sole focus, mailing his results to this false address where the letters piled up through the hole movie. As an Aspie he had no idea that someone could be manipulating him. Until, at last, his wife aims to prove his sanity by driving to the address of this CIA agent, only to find he indeed hadn't been in touch with the CIA and that the letters were just piling up in an unchecked mailbox for months.

Johns reputation is ruined, and he is forced into a psychiatric ward, with a crucial camera-view of the NT character from the beginning of the story smirking as he watched.

This makes me hate my self and sometimes i wish i said something, only to be humiliated even more, so talking caused humiliation as much as muteness did, calmly explaining to an ahole with words stuff seems to be the most assertive approach so far since i always had a meltdown during any conflict and just cried which only made people attack me more, some people share that perople listened to them more when they were quiet but people just told me to talk and were angry, however when i used my voice it was too weak and people just talked over me and didnt care about what i said, and didnt concider it rude, and insutled me, and yet it is such a surprise as to why i avoid them. I feel severely more happy and less depressed when i am around people but in high school i never felt safe and was basically shamed for doing anything, which made me close off more and more until i was ashamed of even breathing and wanted to die. i have never felt like such shit and so helpless and the reason why i hate my self is that i feel weak,

&#x200B;

 if i had a bit more will, i would have been more couragous, but i easily give up and sulk when insulted, i had to pretend nothing hurt me which only turned into a game for the bullies to mentally rape and destroy me, well long story short i am not programmed to be insulted and harassed and thought if i pretend i am not pain they would stop, since they loved to see me cry or angry, the reaction, but in reality they never stopped until i was 18, i didnt even care about my graduation or prom and was still dissapointed, i feel like i havent lived life and time froze and i still grieve about how i could have had friends and a good time if people werent actual aholes, now i am both lonely and think the worst in people and the bullies won which is why i want to die, i mean the bullies won by every parameter even the fact that they are still affecting me today and i  think about them, which is their goal and i cant stop since i feel like i could have done better, i was bullied in middle school and it gave me anxiety but high school gave me paranoia,depression and suicide and suicide is treated as something shameful that only weak people do...and not that i was forced into it after years of humiliation and none of the reports working and being all alone and boys will be boys and them literally never stopping even after they caught girlfriends, i was never saw as a human, let alone a woman

I want to connect wiht someone, it helps me stay alive, to talk, to listen to others talk, exhcange information, touch and i went into severe introversion isolation mode and after i became less depressed i became more hostile and jumpy at people, i dont appreciate presents or hugs, everyone feels so fake and no one is capable of loving me",wkg0yf,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wkg0yf/what_do_you_do_when_you_have_nonverbal_periods/

Now, I was diagnosed with Aspergers at around age 12 and have been told by partners throughout my life that I have a very large penis, and know that due to my own research that this is the case compared with the average stated in many studies. I also have a friend who is autistic who is also particularly large in the penis department.

My question for any fellow autistic penis owners is, do you fall into the larger category compared to the rest of the population? 

For reference the average length in the western part of the world (relevant due to diet influences on penis growth) is between 5-5.5 inches (Non-bone pressed) and average girth is between 4.3-4.8 inches. The reason for these ranges are due to the fact that there hasn‚Äôt been a huge amount of research done on penis size globally.",wjy36u,11,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wjy36u/the_effects_of_increased_prenatal_testosterone_on/

I've been on a lifelong quest to figure out why I feel so different from others. After a serious burnout, I started reading about autism. My brother and niece are on the spectrum (non-verbal, diagnosed as a child), as well as my niece, and I thought that was it. My niece was diagnosed with ADHD a few year ago, and reading about it I present all symptoms, so I have been saying I have ADHD/ASD for over year, while I wait for the ridiculously long waiting lists for assessment (which was hard enough to get into, as doctors are quick to dismiss someone undiagnosed). It is extremely hard to be seen by a psychiatrist in the UK, I have been in hospital multiple times with suicidal moods and attempts, but been placed on short term teams and never evaluated by a psychiatrist.

Upon more reading, I am also consistent with the symptoms of BPD. Is it possible to have all three?

Also the national debt situation, inflation (one in the same as previous problem), people are materialistic, abnormal economics are being applied to things that really should not be (dating),the role of the community has been diminished, the self has been diminished in the name of solidarity, individualism has been crushed, civil liberties are on the down swing, technology is stagnant, and many cities seem to be carbon copies, convenience is not there any more, and what we might call culture is barely holding on for dear life.

513,social conventions for handling a romantic rejection,"['rejection', 'social', 'romantic', 'conventions', 'handling']"," 

I  have a question I would like others to help me clarify what would be a  normal response. So I recently professed my intense feelings towards a  woman I know from an online context. We've gotten rather close in our  friendship over the past 18 months and even made plans to meet each  other up. This other person is the same age as myself, she also has  autism, we have many similar life experiences so this is an exciting  development. However, a recent setback is that I expressed my romantic  attraction towards her and she rejected me. I've been reeling from it  all day but I am not mad at her. Im very sad, upset, depressed, etc but  I'm not mad. And even if she doesn't like me in that way, I'm still  happy to maintain this friendship because I really like her as a person.  Even if things didn't end up happening romantically I still want her to  be my friend because I just like her for herself.

Now  earlier while we were talking about when I expressed myself, I asked if  she wanted me to cancel the tickets. She said she was not sure, she has  to think about some stuff. I'm still working through this but I know I  do want to still meet her. However, what would be the good amount of  time to ask her how she feels? I do not intend to rush her but I also  don't want to know at the last minute. If I'm given enough of an advance  notice, I can cancel most of my purchases for a refund. So I don't want  to sound desparate and I want to be respectful, but I also don't want  to lose out on money if she ends up deciding that she doesn't want to,  for whatever reason.

It's taken a year for me to process what happened, but maybe it's not a big deal.","['lsd', 'spiked', 'drink', 'friend', 'react']","This was a guy I had known for a while but we weren't super close. Throughout knowing him he has occasionally tried to get me to drop acid with him. Now that I know I'm an Aspie, I'm a little worried about his (and others) motivation for this: like me on acid would be some sort of entertainment or oddity for them.  

Anyway, we hung out one night. He said he was going to drop some acid and asked if I wanted to join.  I've long noticed my brain is more sensitive to chemical stimulants, so I ALWAYS decline when offered because my brain clearly has a different reaction to substances. I can't assume that because others are safe taking it that I will be with my unique brain chemistry.

So he said fine. We were both drunk, it was cold out, and I vaguely remember him saying he would make some coffee. 

The next morning, when I was leaving out for work, I drink the hot coffee already sitting there (with the coffee maker ON). I drive down to work as I sip my coffee and get there safely. But I'm feeling off. I attributed it to being some weird hangover symptom as I began unlocking the building for the day. As I'm unlocking, it was like I became totally disoriented. In the building I've worked at for a year, I was suddenly lost. It was as if I was dreaming the way everything seemed obscured around me, but I was clearly awake and very scared.  I told my coworker I wasn't feeling well, and I just sat down right there on the floor. I'm not sure how she reacted, but given how people see us as weird, she probably didn't take it seriously as a potential emergency. it seems she thought I purposely did drugs before work. My coworker later came to me and asked if I was high that morning. 

I told her no, of course not, and that I was just feeling dehydrated from drinking last night.

I was confused and disoriented and clearly drugged. I'm honestly not sure how much time passed. But I came-to at some point and just went to my desk and tried to process what-the-fuck was happening. Later that day I met the same friend for lunch, and was still feeling a little off and probably mentioned that to him. He asked if I drank the coffee that morning. I said yes. He said nothing more, but did offer some facial expression that I remember wasn't what I'd expect over a regular pot of coffee. It took me weeks to make the connection

Some of my Aspergers symptoms got significantly worse around that time too, but that could be due to many other things like stress so IDK right now. 

I'm terrified that someone would do this to me. Even if drugging me wasn't on purpose, to not tell me what happened when you clearly know it was in the coffee? To do that to my body, even if it was accidental, and not let me know?

Never hast this ever happened to me before this or since.

IDK what to do. It feels serious and as an Aspie it terrifies me that someone would do that to me when I clearly don't have the same defenses and awareness that they do.

&#x200B;

These are 3 things im obsessed with and id love to have somebody to talk about these with on a deeper level. Although because ive never truly found anybody interested in them like i am I dont know how wed even go about this. Not that i cant carry on a conversation but you know what i mean, or maybe you dont? I dont know lol.

Im posting in the aspergers sub because I believe I may have it and ive had aspie friends in the past i really got along well with. Especially a penpal who was writing a cyberpunk novel, but she wasnt into gaming at all but i still enjoyed talking about different story related things with her and i felt sort of understood. It was great.

A little about my journey to this point. Theres a show on netflix im sure yall are all familiar with called love on the spectrum. I could relate to a few of the people on the show and also after looking up some info on this and taking some online tests one of which was paid it showed me as having about 50/50 traits NT and it said some fairly strong aspie traits. Ive always felt different than other people. I somehow managed to get married and have two kids that ended in divorce recently. I feel lke part of that is due to me being who i am and how i am. I genuinely like who i am i just dont seem to fit anywhere.

I am 47 years old and I feel like most of my life ive just been stumbling through and not understanding who i really am or my place here. Because im definitely different than most people ive met and I just am tired of feeling lonely and out of place and like nobody cares about the things I care about. With stories and music and video games at times I feel like im truly myself.  A moment in a story where something exciting happens or the music reaches a crescendo or a song that gets stuck in my head and i have to listen to on repeat. Like synthwave music i absolutely LOVE and I feel more like myself when I listen to that. I have all these mental issues theyve diagnosed me with but i wonder honestly if im not just who I am and thats how my brain works and theres nothing wrong with me at all other than being not like the majority of people.

Id really love to have friends but it feels like some pipe dream at this point. I have some people ive gamed with for a very long time online and I have them I can talk to and some others, so its not like I dont have anybody to talk to at least to make small talk etc. But i HATE small talk and would rather talk about deeper things and how things work, and the whos whats whys and hows of a thing.

Im also TRYING dating through online dating and thats a real freaking nightmare shitshow hellscape stab me with a fork im done kind of rollercoaster ride through the 87th level of hell. But you know other than that its not ""too bad"".

&#x200B;

I actually dont know what the point of this post is except im looking to find my place in the world and this is my latest stop i guess on my journey. I dont display a lot of aspie things but other things I feel like its spot on. I feel so MUCH and I do have trouble reading social cues and things but in other ways its like i can see directly through peoples masks that they wear and looks straight to the heart of the matter.  I know I cant be the only one like this. It sucks not having a tribe or group of people or belonging anywhere. Even in a loose fashion.  I dont WANT to have aspergers I just think I do have it and at some point i will go try to get an official diagnoses from an expert. In the meantime though id love to talk about some sci fi, fantasy, horror, video games, books, movies, tv shows, listen to some music together and talk about it or I honestly dont know what it is im even looking for. Somebody to hangout with on discord and game with, a penpal, I dont know.  Somebody that understands where im coming from because im tried of ""dumbing myself down"" making myself dull so i can not feel totally out of place in this world.

&#x200B;

Its so hard too with people in general to form a bond especially online because its too easy to dissapear. People you think will be around forever one day they just for all intents and purposes ""dont exist"" anymore. I mean they quit coming online get busy with life etc. Thats fine, i know thats how it works but wouldnt it be amazing I think to find a person or group of people that loved the same things I do and just have a place to call home, even a virtual place would be fine. Like the title of that movie. I dont feel at home in this world anymore.

Theres a word I really like Hiraeth its a welsh word.  [It means a longing for a place a home a feeling that no longer or maybe never existed.](https://www.learning-mind.com/hiraeth-deep-thinkers/)

I write poetry sometimes when im inspired but ive felt dead inside a long time because this world wasnt made for me and not I for it. But i have wrote some more recently and it helps a little bit.

I feel like I got just enough of aspergers to have all the good parts of it and not too many of the bad. I know its a mixed bag. But that feels like me too a paradox a mix of things that dont really fit fighting and swirling around trying to live in harmony. I feel like I know too much and absolutely nothing all at the same time. I actually since im getting older spend a lot of time thinking about death. Not in a morbid im suicidal way but im looking forward to that because I believe in GOD and the afterlife and I want to see wha'ts beyond this plane of existence. I love exploring, learning, experiencing, I love LIFE itself. Im an INFP on the myers briggs and they have said a lot of the major great [writers were too.](https://www.personalityclub.com/blog/famous-infp/)  I feel like a writer whos too lazy to write and it feels like I should but what would be the point?

(I also realize myers briggs is only for entertainment but its still an interesting thing in the way astrology is i guess, i dont take it super seriously)

Theres a scene in a movie that stars Willem Dafoe about  [Van Goghs life ""At Eternitys Gate""](https://vimeo.com/497685619) and hes talking to a priest where hes in a mental institution about his art and how people dont get it and they decide maybe the people who appreciate it arent born yet. I am in NO WAY shape or form comparing myself to great people like him or that list of writers and artists. Just saying my brain works and hear is in a similar shape or fashion and I feel the exclusion from society and truly know what being an outcast is like and its tiring after almost half a decade of this and no true empathy or understanding from people. Its no wonder people go mad that feel this way. I try my best not to give into loneliness and despair but its always at the back of my mind/heart/spirit.

I also feel like sometimes looking for a friend (or even people that can relate) is where you need to be like a salesmen and I dont want to sell myself. I just want to connect with people and have them get me. But due to the way life works i cant go through the natural process of meeting people because im so burnt out on this whole thing. The whole great and secret show. (One of my favorite books btw). It feels like people cant see the forest for the trees and theres so much beauty and wonder in life.

516,"Embarrassed that I like certain people so much, but suddenly very lonely","['lonely', 'embarrassed', 'suddenly', 'like', 'people']","When I like someone very much, I act in a way that is very obvious. Like for example, I would like everything they post on Facebook, or ask if I could sit next to them. It maybe does not seem like a lot, but I am so awkward, and so obviously happy to see them, that it is obvious in comparison to my baseline behavior. When I do not see them for a while, I realize how stupid and creepy I must look, and am very ashamed.

I am really lucky. There are people in my life I am always very happy to see, and many others that I like very much, just do not see anymore or just do not know well. It is real blessing to be able to feel this way. Sometimes, all I have to do is think about a person I love, and I am not so angry anymore. But they are professional relationships, it is a burden and creepy that I love them so much. I am on break now, and ashamed of how obvious I was during the school year.

I always prided self on not needing anyone. But I am under some stress at moment. I suddenly thought of a kind thing one of my teachers said to me, and I suddenly wanted painfully much to be back in that moment. Not so I could tell him about what is happening to me, or even so I could hear him say kind thing again, I just wanted to be able to say hello, and be consoled by being in same room as him for a couple minutes. I am ashamed of how weak and creepy I have become, I think this is why I always embarrass self. My mom has a German Shepherd, she is very proud and loyal. She will wander over to sit with my mom, not because she wants anything, but because she wants to be nearby. I am like this, but I am an awkward and nervous adult man, not a cute dog, so it is very creepy. I wish very much it was not break, and I could go sit with my friend and do homework, or make up a question to ask my teacher so that I could go to his office hours for a few minutes.

No therapy or meds helped except ssri and maoi (most of it made it worse). Strongly suspect Asperger's but feel like although I used to have strong traits in childhood I sort of ""managed"" them through disassociation, avoidance, masking, etc. I feel like now I have no idea who I even am. I can appear ""normal"" (even ""fun""/social), was able to move out in early 20s and to a new city, can sort of take care of myself etc but I also have no friends, isolate for days at a time, get irritable too easy, couldn't finish college can't hold down a job for very long etc. I go from crappy job to crappy job once I get burnt out and can't take it anymore, etc. Longest job I had was a year and like 9 months? Most don't even last a year. I literally do not relate to any other human and feel like I am a master at telling people what they want so they like me. But I feel no real connection like 95% of the time. Most people I meet I wouldn't care if I never saw them again. (Even if we have a ""great time"" I feel like it's just extended small talk and there's no real connection) I am not a psychopath (although I've feared I was one at times) and I do not wish harm to others. I desperately WANT to connect with other people, I just don't. 

Asperger's is the only thing that really fits? I'm not the suicidal doom and gloom type of depressive, I don't have bipolar disorder, I'm not a drug user or alcoholic. I just cannot function in society. Or I barely can? Everything feels like it takes me so much energy. I remember in highschool when I would finally come home from school I would get off the bus and I felt like such a burden had been lifted off of me. I've never felt comfortable around others the way I feel being alone. 

Many of the other traits of autism I don't think fit me? Most sensory stuff doesn't bother me I don't think? I often do get irritated tho and I cannot wait to take uncomfortable clothes off once I get home and I cannot wear certain stuff because it's too uncomfortable. (Jewelry, tight clothes) but it's not like extreme or anything. I understand most sarcasm and jokes. I often do not understand others behavior however. Things that couples fight about or other people get upset about I often find pretty stupid and petty and I don't know why people do half the shit they do honestly. I have also never been in any real romantic relationship. (Dated but it wasn't much of a connection, etc)

I also have problems with understanding criticism and feedback. I often feel that what a manager or boss tells me to do is either stupid or it's just personal shit they're pushing on me to be petty. 

I just really don't like being around people. I don't hate people, I just feel comfortable alone. People are unpredictable and I hate that I guess? I feel as if I will do or say the wrong thing and not have ""successful social interaction"" basically. Most of my interactions are successful tho as I am avoidant of interaction I don't want, keep interaction surface level and know the right sort of things to say? I cannot let a relationship get any more intimate or else I feel I will kind of reveal my ""real"" self however. Antidepressants also kind of help keep the anxiety at a manageable level.

Now I'm a bit older and ill break a small rule if it's it's a good reason but I still get that 'oh god, oh god' feeling whenever I get caught.

I've never been in a relationship before, and have instead focused my time on work, education, and hobbies. I've done well for myself, and am both mentally and financially in a good place...but I have no idea how to be in a relationship or meet someone. 

Like most Aspies, I'm adept at details and use the method of Loci technique to pick up on interests, mannerisms, and linguistic patterns on people, storing information in the memory palace for future use. It makes for a very good first date, as women feel connected due to my knowledge base of their interests. Second date and beyond tend to have diminishing returns, as I don't feel a similar connection and I am also Asexual. It has been my experience that neurotypical women get confused when sexual advances or flirtations are not reciprocated, leading them to either question their self worth or my preferences. There are also consistent issues I've found with NT women dating in their 40s, but I'm in a bit of a glass house so I will refrain from throwing rocks.

Online dating in my area is problematic due to a bizarre hyper focus on political affiliations, and I've tried dating services without avail. I've tried friends of coworkers, but as I age the pool has emptied. I also do Meetup, a book club, volunteer, and go to the gym to have that sense of interaction with other people, but I've never really met a woman in those settings that I am interested in.

I feel like the ""love will find you when you least expect it""  conversation is more appropriate for someone in their 20s. Perhaps I'm being a tad maudlin, but I've been in the same career field coming on 20 years and all of my friends and coworkers now have kids in college.

My twin and I are identical, so the percentage of that happening was higher. The doctors said that there was a 10% I'd live and if I did live, I'd be born mentally handicapped. 

Well, I got aspergers as a result of it, albeit high-functioning (as well as Dyscalculia, which not only affects numbers but directions, spacing, etc. Didn't get my license until I was 20). Asburgers has been a curse my whole life. I just wanna fix my brain, make it so I don't do the things I do and say the things I say. Make it so that I dont push people away because I'm too weird or they can't understand me, etc. 

I can't wait for the right guy to love me for me, I know he's out there, even if he's the guy I'm interested in right now, he's still there, though so many days I get so disheartened and it seems like I'm not getting better and I'm still too weird, etc. I know I have wonderful weirdness (I think we all have some measure of that), though I just sometimes don't understand myself and get frusterated with myself and why I act the way I do and say what I say. 

Is there hope for me to get better? Or am I stuck with this curse? It's like a part of my brain is missing. 

One of the things I'll never forget that helps to keep me going is what my dad said to me when I was a kid (he passed away from MS ((Multiple Sclerosis)) when I was 14). One day I asked him why I was so weird and he said it's not that I'm weird (in a bad way) or different in a bad way, it's that when I was in the womb I was fighting for my life, to survive and I used all I had and more and so that's why I'm the way I am, I'm a fighter and a survivor.

Let me elaborate with some examples. I think - and this is my opinion, which I am allowed to have and strongly believe in - that drinking & smoking is a pointless attack on your health and serves no purpose, and that partying is an absolutely grating experience.

This being said, when other humans tell me that they engage in such activities, I try to show acceptance and not judge them on that sort of behavior, since it's not my place to moralize them on their own life.

Yet, this acceptance is often a one way street. For instance, if I tell my mother, or a colleague that I do not drink,  or party, or smoke, or have any kind of social relationships since reading books is all I need to make me happy,  you can be sure that they'll do their very best to induce feelings of guilt and try forcing me to change.

I have a fixed routine, which makes me extremely happy, but for them I'm ""wasting my life"".  I should go see a shrink because of my 'abnormal lifestyle'. I am a 'freak' for not partying and a 'psycho' for willfully having no friends & not eating meat.  I am 'a failure' for quitting a job which made me suicidal and learning programming.

All of this pessimism & toxicity contrasts with how I actually feel, I'm very happy with my current life, and I'm tired to fight off people who try to get me to be like them. Their lives are not made for me.

Why is it expected to express tolerance towards those who fit the mold but acceptable to judge you if your lifestyle is different?

We‚Äôve only been dating a few months, but our connection was instant and intense, almost like we could both immediately sense that we were somehow the ‚Äúsame‚Äù in ways. This has been a good thing, but it also kind of concerns me. This relationship doesn‚Äôt look or feel like any relationships I‚Äôve had with NT partners.

For instance, we are both very quiet. We enjoy the mutual silence, on some level, but it also feels ‚Äúwrong.‚Äù In this stage of the relationship I think we both feel pressure to be talking constantly, especially in order to justify the intensity of our affection for each other, but it doesn‚Äôt come naturally (unless we‚Äôre both drunk, and then we excitedly talk non-stop for hours.)

I think we‚Äôre both used to being with NT partners and mirroring the energy/behavior of those partners, but it‚Äôs like with each other we both feel too seen being fake and mirroring, and also struggle with talking when we don‚Äôt genuinely want to? It‚Äôs not uncomfortable, per se, but I think we‚Äôre both a little at a loss with how to relate to each other when neither of us are masking (even though, on a deeper level, we *know* we understand each other, without really having to constantly be saying things.)

543,"Not diagnosed, but he is similar to my Asperger's nephews","['asperger', 'diagnosed', 'similar', 'nephews']","Hello all,

Reddit helped me a while back with my kiddo in getting a celiac diagnosis. Now I'm looking to see if I'm correct is pursuing an autism diagnosis for him as well. I'm going to try and answer as many questions as I can, but I may be scatter brained as well.

So here's why I think he has high functioning autism-

He is so similar to my 19yo nephew. (They were diagnosed at around 8/9). My son is currently 7.5

He lacks empathy- I can try and explain a situation to him in where I have feelings that were similar to his (anxiety, sadness). He doesn't understand or put it together. I recently lost my dad, and he either stares at me or laughs when I'm crying. There was also a kid who had a seizure in class one day...instead of being worried, he was ü§∑ü§∑

His mood is always meh. He doesn't show emotions well, and we have to listen to his words to actually tell if he was excited or happy. He does show some stuff, like frustration or anxiousness. 

He gets fixated on something- yesterday is was a floaty at a pool. He *refused* to let it go, didn't eat or drink safe foods because he was obsessed with the floaty. It's the same with games or TV shows/something he really wants/likes to do.

He's impulsive. He *loves* to bang toys into stuff and break stuff. Books have torn pages or colored in (which is normal for little kids...but he's almost 8). He hits, especially when having a tantrum or he wants to get his way. 

He doesn't make constant eye contact, but I also do this too (I feel weird staring people in the eye when chatting, so I almost always look around while talking). He can hold a conversation well though.

His teacher was saying he has a really high reading level, but he has a hard time recalling what the book/section was that he just read.

He hand flaps when watching TV. Not every single time, but when he's really excited or there's an anxiety producing moment (he loves watching dangerous animal videos). He will flap or jump on the couch. 


*Gross info coming in*
He plays in his bum...often. and will play in the poop on his fingers like paint. He also wets his pants *at least* once a day, and he's been potty trained for over 4 years. I'm not sure if it's a texture thing or what, but it's hard constantly cleaning poo every day.

Changing seating areas makes him anxious. He has a meltdown if he doesn't have the same chair/spot at home (it has happened other places, like our RV or when we went to a fam reunion). They aren't massive meltdowns, but enough that everyone is frustrated, so we end up keeping the same seats. 

He has major food aversions. We have safe food and not safe food. Thankfully he's opening up a little and *trying* new foods, but with the celiacs, it's hard. 


Anyway! Sorry this is so long. These are all the major concerns I'm taking to his therapist, but I wanted to see if this is something similar. I hate the tests/quizzes, because his signs are different than just the typical 'yes/no' answer. But it's hard to explain to the therapist because they just want the paper test to show yes.

551,Why I hate my only friend,"['hate', 'friend']","I'm trying to avoid reddit rants but I'm drunk, pissed off and have nowhere else to turn too. So help a brother out?

Anyways I have a friend who I've known for about 14 years. For context about fourish years ago he had a really bad break up; which was made worse by the fact that his family (in hindsight probably with reason even if their methods were extreme) hated her. I tried to be a sympathetic friend; I hung out with him all the time but he could really be a dick. Here's an example:  he asked me if I wanted to go out to a bar to meet some woman. He had the never to just ditch me and go out by himself and ask me for a lift....three times in a row. I think it's fair to say he used me like a taxi, and he would often put me in the middle of arguments with his family. During his next fucked up relationship; I bumped into him during the library; he asked if I wanted to something; I desperately needed the time to study but said  something like I can spare 15. He used me as a verbal punching back for like three hours. Later on during the first relationship I had; I asked him if I could talk about it. He said yes; blew me off; then cancelled the other previously made plans when I told him we just broke up and I needed to get my mind off it.  We didn't live in the same town for a while; during the small times when we did he would constantly blow me off because of family issues.

Anyways going back to recent years when he moved back in. He constantly ditches me at the last minute; I think there's something like a 38% chance he'll show up when he says he will. I reached out to him about three weeks in advance saying I had spent the last four birthdays in a row drinking alone; could we please get dinner together so I don't have to do that? He blows me off without mentioning a reason although to be fair he does give me some food (I was living off of toast at that point) as a bday presen. He keeps on bailing; although I still make a point of helping him out. Usually what happened was he said something came up; let's take a raincheck; then the same thing happened with the raincheck. One of my favorite examples was on the few times when we did hangout; he got a call from his grandpa asking if he wanted a beer or something; he just canceled our plans there and then to hangout with his grandpa.

It got to the point where I finally snapped; I think my exact words were your intention is ambiguous;; your actions are not.To be fair he was going through some shit with disasterous relationship number three; he just broke up with her the other week. I try and reset the clock and cut him some slack. He still bails but if I'm being honest; it's only slightly worse than his usual behavior over the last few years. Anyways we just had a big fight because he just ditched me again tonight. He had a somewhat legitimate reason but because this was the third time this week he pushed it back I snapped then almost immediately apologized. This some how turned into an argument about how I'm too negative because I complained about my parents two weeks ago and a former boss something like three months; he kept on going on and on about how I need therapy (I'm looking into one this week but my workload has doubled overnight so I'm a little busy).  The main reason I'm not in it is financial); I pointed out the last time I was they told me I lashed out because I didn't set boundaries. This ended up with him accusing me of faking autism, calling me a horny bastard (okay maybe that part is true), and just taking every chance he can to berate me. To be fair; there are some factors that favor him but I'm sick of his shit, drunk and exhausted; if anyone wants context post in the comments.",wj3kdc,6,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wj3kdc/why_i_hate_my_only_friend/

559,Always felt like an outcast. On a mission to understand why.,"['outcast', 'felt', 'understand', 'mission', 'like']","Hi everyone. I haven't been officially diagnosed, as being on the spectrum wasn't something I took into consideration until recently. I've contacted my psychiatrist and we're talking in 2 weeks, but wanted to vent my frustrations here (if that's okay).  


A little bit about me: I'm 28 (M) years old and made a career playing electronic music for about 5 years. Once the pandemic hit, I no longer could play shows and went into a very dark place mentally. Things have gotten a lot better in that department since then, and I've been interviewing for jobs recently. When I was 8 years old I was diagnosed with ADHD and have always been lost in my thoughts/day dreaming - I was an unruly child to say the least. When I was younger, I hated loud sounds and couldn't go see fireworks or anything of that nature. Bright lights were also a problem and going to stores such as Home Depot or Lowes would cause me to get upset. Without ADHD medication, I can sit and daydream for hours on end. I always stared at the ground when walking and thought that everyone did that, and in general I've always been the complete opposite of self-aware. There were things that I had never noticed about myself until I was older, and it's taken a lot of time to adjust to societal norms that I've noticed. Some more examples are that I never smile or laugh even if I think something is funny, people assume I'm mad when I'm not, and I often get labeled as an asshole for reasons I don't usually understand.   


As far as I know, I've always had very obsessive tendencies. My father had substance abuse issues and passed away when I was 3, and was known to be obsessive too. I have a insatiable desire to pick my eye brows and if I can't pick my eyebrow I start getting irritated and stressed which makes me think about it more. My mind races a million miles per hour, and my mother told me that my dad was similar in that regard. This is probably why I gravitate towards music, as it helps keep my thoughts sorted and takes the edge off. The only other thing that seems to help slow my brain is cannabis, even though I wish that wasn't the case.   


I love being alone, but I do have friends (lost a lot of previous friends because of this). As I've gotten older, I've gotten better at making friends and talking to people but it took a LOT of work. I'd say the first 25 years of my life felt like a constant battle to understand how to talk to people and get certain reactions, as it's never felt natural to me. It can be extremely draining for me to be around groups of people for extended periods and keep up with my ""act."" I'd say that being around more than 5 people causes me to get exhausted within 30 minutes or so because of all the different personalities. 1 on 1 conversations are preferred as I can dial in on who I'm talking to really digest what's going on.  


Overall, I feel like a lot of these tendencies and issues I've had throughout my life still reside with me today. The only difference between then and now is that I can hide it well, and talk to my therapist on a monthly basis which helps sort my thoughts a bit. Even with the therapy I still get pretty overwhelmed with my thoughts and patterns at times and just feel like crying (I cry maybe twice a year and dang does it feel good) out of feeling crazy.   


Recently, one of my friends brought up Asperger's in a conversation and naturally I got curious and started looking at topics here on reddit. The amount I relate to some of these posts gives me comfort and understanding of myself, even though I'm not sure if I do fall on the spectrum in this way. I really hope I'm not infringing in this sub by not being officially diagnosed, but I appreciate anyone listening to my frustrations and giving me a chance to speak about the issues I've faced.   


I don't think I have any questions or anything, but if anyone wants to talk or faces similar issues please feel free to reach out. I think just writing my thoughts out and consolidating some issues has been beneficial, so thank you for allowing me to write and speak.",wijlr1,36,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wijlr1/always_felt_like_an_outcast_on_a_mission_to/

568,How does one go about getting diagnosed as an adult?,"['diagnosed', 'adult', 'getting', 'does']"," I'm in my late 20s. Ever since I can remember I've had extreme difficulty socializing and forming relationships. My mom says I never wanted to interact with other kids when I was little but my pediatrician just brushed it off saying that it was a phase and that I would grow out of it. Of course, I never really did. In hindsight, most of my interactions with my childhood ""friends"" involved me playing along side them, and not with them, if that makes any sense. I also get sensory overload and feel physically sick whenever I'm in large crowds. I'm like 90% sure I'm on the autism spectrum.

I've been to a couple of psychologists, one when I was 16 and another when I was 21. Neither seemed very helpful or interested in my concerns and the latter one cancelled on me constantly, which left a bad taste in my mouth so I just stopped going.

574,AITA For Not Attending My Moms Wedding?,"['aita', 'wedding', 'attending', 'moms']","TLDR AT THE BOTTOM

Let me preface this, my mom is a hopeless romantic type. Despite being traumatized time and time again by dating she desperately wants to find love and get married. It‚Äôs practically her life‚Äôs  mission is to get married and live happily ever after essentially. 

But she‚Äôs a bit delusional about it, she it very picky on the type of men she dates, he must be a HARDCORE Christian and preferably older, the worse deal breaker is that she refuses to have sex with any man she dates until marriage. Unsurprisingly she‚Äôs been single for 17 years. 

Until now! Normally I‚Äôd be happy but my moms new fling is giving me Narc vibes. Things between them are moving WAAAY too fast, after 2 weeks he was already sleeping over. Due to her being ‚ÄúCelibate‚Äù this behavior is unusual. I also feel that he overshares a lot, but not genuinely. He tells my mother his ex-Wife divorced him for ‚Äúuncontrollably serial cheating‚Äù but claims to be a change man because he found ‚ÄúChrist‚Äù. Everybody in my family thinks it‚Äôs bullshit and that he‚Äôs just taking advantage of her desperation. 

My mom even started picking up on the red flags but she flip flops a lot. One minute she‚Äôs done with him because he‚Äôs and inconsistent liar who can‚Äôt be trusted, and the next she‚Äôll say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs never too late to change‚Äù. One day she even told me she found out he‚Äôs still dating multiple women. She isn‚Äôt even acting like herself, she literally broke things off with this jerk and got back with him the same day! 

Her end goal is to get married and fulfill her fantasy. Nobody in my family likes this dude due to his character flaws, but my mom CHOOSES to be as blind as can be‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ If/When she marries him I don‚Äôt don‚Äôt plan on going to the wedding.

But she was constantly analyzing everything I did and looking for reasons to end it and letting her condition dictate the whole relationship, siting my love language ‚Äúwords of affirmation‚Äù wasn‚Äôt something she could fulfill. Which I was perfectly fine with AFTER we would eventually become official. I go all in at the start of a relationship and when things settle down and routine sets in I tend to withdraw and do my own thing while my partner does theirs and we meet in the middle at the end of the day. I don‚Äôt need the reassurance after I secure the bag. Just in the beginning when we‚Äôre in the ‚Äútalking stage‚Äù because we‚Äôre not actually together. 

I mentioned I was still adjusting to her which she didn‚Äôt like at all. But how else could I explain it. I‚Äôve never dated an aspie so of course I‚Äôm not used to the withdraw at the beginning. I‚Äôm used to both parties in constant communication and wanting to spend as much time as possible together. It was honestly refreshing because it felt like we skipped the whole honeymoon phase which most of the time is just best faces and bullshit. 

She said I did everything right, listed off everything someone would want from a partner and could see us being good for a year or two but long long term I couldn‚Äôt handle the withdrawal which I totally disagree with. My track record of my marriage and relationships telling me I couldn‚Äôt love them the way they needed due to my tendency to withdraw. So she reverse uno carded me. 

We had a great time together in person it was just when we‚Äôre apart I would be anxious and want to talk to her since she was brand new in my life, I was well aware she‚Äôs not wired that way so I was slowly just getting used to it. I was adjusting just like anyone would do with any new partner. She literally has every quality I want in a partner. I told her her Asperger‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt bother me because it really doesn‚Äôt . I like her for her and that‚Äôs it. But she ended it regardless after I tried to tell her this.

583,Relationship advice needed ‚Ä¶ kind of long,"['relationship', 'long', 'advice', 'kind', 'needed']","Hi everyone. I know I could post this in a relationship advice forum, but I don‚Äôt think NTs will understand my predicament and feelings like you guys here do. So I hope you don‚Äôt mind if I post here for some relationship advice.
My spouse and I have been having an increasing amount of issues. We have been together since 2016. We met online, knew each other in real life for less than 3 months, and got married. But, now we have been married over 5 years and know each other quite well. 

I will preface by saying there is quite a lot of resentment from both sides of us towards the other. However, I am not a grudge-holder, and I try my best to move on from the past. He, as an NT, says he has forgiven me for things in the past, but obviously still holds a grudge towards me. (I wish he would just say he still has a grudge toward me, instead of confusing me by saying he doesn‚Äôt). 
So anyways, here is the big thing. I used to use weed to deal with a lot of my sensory issues. I would smoke and noises/smells/textures/etc would bother me less. They still really bothered me, but wouldn‚Äôt lead to melt downs. Well, I quit again almost 2 months ago and my sensory issues have been off the charts again. I have problems with my upstairs neighbor smoking weed and the smell coming through my oven vent, and I have issues with my side neighbor blasting her TV on full volume 24/7 (not exaggerating, literally 24/7). Today, my other side neighbor was practicing his piano at 6:30 AM ‚Ä¶ lol‚Ä¶. and he‚Äôs not good. I keep going to my spouse expressing how distressing these things are to me, and how they‚Äôre making it really difficult for me to be living here. He just gets pissed and says ‚ÄòWell, what do you want *me* to do about it???‚Äô. I‚Äôve expressed that having his support in talking to these neighbors or contacting the landlord would go a long way for me, or even just him being understanding and saying everything will be ok would help. He gets increasingly mad and defensive over these conversations and increasingly annoyed with each time a meltdown happens. I feel like such a freak. I go to therapist, and psychiatrist, and I‚Äôm trying so hard to seem as normal as possible for the people around me but I am getting so tired.

Three nights ago, I got super startled by this image of a burnt body being shown on TV (CSI came on after Big Brother). I was really scared and looked away and kept asking him to please turn off the TV and that Im very disturbed by what I saw. He kept saying I had no reason to be that scared, that it looked like a ‚Äòham with Mr. Potato eyes‚Äô and that it wasn‚Äôt even scary. I kept insisting I was really freaked out and please turn it off. He wouldn‚Äôt. I left the room to go brush my teeth, came back a couple minutes later, CSI was still on. I got upset about this and he couldn‚Äôt understand why. I explained that it was because it felt like he didn‚Äôt care about my feelings and it hurt that he wouldn‚Äôt just turn it off. We ended up not talking the rest of the night and going to bed.

Two nights ago, out of the blue, I saw a man run up to the nook of my neighbor and I door at 10:30 PM. I stared at the door to see if there would be a knock, and then BOOM!!!!! the loudest knock/kick on the door ever and the guy walks away quickly. I got so freaked out and paranoid about this happening and it really really shook me up. I ended up calling the police because I was so terrified. My spouse kept insisting if I am so scared about it that I must know who hit the door like that or something. I kept repeating that I am really scared and I can‚Äôt sleep because I was scared they were going to come back. And he screamed at me to stop repeating that I‚Äôm scared and that I‚Äôm annoying. I tried to get over this and act normal yesterday. I said I would really need help staying calm at night because of my fear/paranoia

Yesterday, I was still extremely scared about the door knock/kick person. I continued to repeat about my fear and he called me annoying about it again and insisted I must know more information if I‚Äôm that scared about it. Well, he comes home from work and we are relaxing on the couch. I realize my lab values from my bloodwork came back. I notice I have some low labs that could indicate I need to increase protein intake (I have a degree and am a registered nutritionist who is not practicing at this time, but have lots of experience with analyzing lab values). My husband, works in a lab calibrating machines and running samples through the machines. He stated, I shouldn‚Äôt just assume I need to do X or Y and that the machine could have been calibrated to make the labs come through low. I stated that is possible, but they are out of range regardless and that I have a lot of experience with this. He stated ‚ÄòI work in a lab!!!! Are you really going to disrespect me??‚Äô I got really angry and stood up for myself and said ‚ÄòI have experience with actually analyzing the labs, not just with the machines that produce the results, I know what I am talking about here‚Äô. He got so upset that he left the room and fell asleep on the bed. I tried to talk to him more, but he was sleeping, so I left him alone. 

He came out around 8PM when the sun was setting. I was getting increasingly worried about that door knock/kick person coming back and he said earlier before the fight it would be ok because he wouldn‚Äôt let anything happen. Well, he walked right out of the room to go hide in the bedroom again and completely ignored me. I felt really abandoned by him now because he knows it is getting dark and I am definitely getting really worried. He doesnt care. Finally, at 9:30 PM I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore (I was reading in the completely dark living room with only a tiny book light so that person wouldn‚Äôt know anyone was home) and I went to bed. I was tossing and turning worried about it happening again for about 20 minutes when suddenly I hear my spouse shuffling around and the door close. I look at his side of the bed and he had taken his pillow to go sleep in the living room couch again (third time this week, maybe fourth - other times were because he has such bad gas that it makes me wake up and almost need to throw up - this is a new problem). I felt so alone and uncared for in this moment. Because he also knows I am scared that this mysterious person will break into the bedroom window and assured me everything would be ok because he is sleeping in there.

Anyways, if you are reading this far down the post - thank you so much. I am just really confused about his treatment toward me. If I approach it with him, or express my feelings to him, it will turn into how I am the abusive one and I am the one who causes the problems - that he is just an innocent victim basically and I am the horrible person. I am so exhausted of living my life like this - but I am so scared of being alone. I am worried that I wont be able to 1. afford to live alone, or 2. be able to provide myself the essentials like groceries and paying bills on time alone. I feel so trapped. We have tried marriage counseling in the past with multiple people and it didn‚Äôt do much of anything to help. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I guess I am looking for advice, words of comfort, or maybe someone who has similar experience to this.

589,I'm finally home,"['home', 'finally']","To the observer, my life has been quite the struggle. To me, more so, as the struggle of not knowing why my life was such a struggle superceded the struggle itself.

Well. As of the 4th of August, what has been a long first chapter of my life, has finally ended. I knew I was lost, didn't know where I was, didn't know which way was home, I didn't even know what home really was supposed to feel like. Had no map, had no compass. Cursed to stumble through the wilderness on pure hope. Wandering about in a fog for so long that you can no longer distinguish hope from desperation.

It all ended in a grand season finale. Despite my social struggles in, well, every aspect of my life, my obsession with logic, my apparently peculiar interests especially as a kid; license plates, astronomy, electrical systems, gardening, classical music, anatomy, sea depths. Despite my struggles with the school system, despite the bullying, despite being ostracised, despite the it being very obvious to any adult that I did not enjoy life, I was never caught.

I was never caught, until now, at the ripe age of 30 years. The first time I myself took action, was back in 2011, where I asked my doctor to be referred to a psychologist. I never was able to act on that referral. From 2011 to 2019 I went back and forth to the doctor asking for referrals that I never acted on. In 2020 I met a girl, she became my girlfriend. Quite the coincidence that this girl was actually a psychologist. (Fun fact, on our very first date, within the first 10 minutes of meeting each other, she jokingly asked me ""are you autistic?"". Well, in retrospect, maybe that wasn't jokingly.)
This girlfriend would come to observe my struggles first hand for some time, and within the first few months of being together she asked me if I ever had an assessment for ADHD. No, I had never, but that didn't matter, because I never followed through with my appointments anyway.
She took me to the doctor, I got a referral to a psychiatrist, she booked an appointment, 2 years later, at the start of 2022, I was sitting in that psychiatrists office. In the meantime I had screwed up the relationship the only way I knew how, being myself.
The psychiatrist gave me the diagnosis ADHD and I started medication. Over the next 6 months I ran through methylphenidate and lisdexamphetamine while I started feeling progressively worse and worse.
I started doubting my psychiatrist, so I started reading everything on psychiatry. I consulted my family on observations on my behaviour, on family history. Then my older sister mentioned our grandmother being bipolar. Bipolar etched itself in my mind, and I brought that concern to my psychiatrist. At the psychiatrist office, I had had enough time to ruminate, and by this time I was almost certain that I was bipolar. I just needed an expert to give the final seal of approval. After 10 minutes of talking, my psychiatrist vaguely said ""that sounds manic depressive"", but something ""sounding manic depressive"" does not equal ""you are now diagnosed with bipolar"". I needed certainty, so I asked him, ""does that mean that I am bipolar?"", and he answered with a faint ""yes"", never taking his eyes away from the computer screen he was looking at.

Being diagnosed with bipolar was fuel on a fire and the following month, I was reading and subconsciously integrating everything that was bipolar. I started feeling very very bad, and very very scared, I was afraid that I was manic and that I was going to lose my mind. I had several episodes, or attacks, extreme emotional incidents that I didn't know how to explain in any other way than ""this must be mania, I must be losing my mind"". It got so bad, that I ended up calling the psychiatric emergency room, frantically telling them that I was bipolar, that I thought I might be manic and that I was afraid that I would go insane. They really wanted to talk to me. So I went to the psychiatric emergence room. At the facility, I had a talk about my history and my current state, with a nurse and a doctor. I was feeling extremely bad at this point, I felt like I was disassociating or going to faint, my mind was racing out of control, my heart was beating out of my chest, my mouth so dry that I could barely speak, my words stumbled on each other as I frantically tried to answer the doctors questions and present every relevant piece of information to them.

The doctor was left of facial expressions. No gesturing. His voice monotonous. He spent more time looking at his notebook that he did at me.
Then the doctor stopped my frantic response to his question and asked me ""Do you remember what I just asked you?"".
I felt the world disintegrate around me. I knew that my ability to answer this question was of great importance, otherwise why would he ask? I was so afraid that something was wrong with me, that I was going insane, but he just presented me the possibility of proving to myself that I wasn't insane. I just had to remember what he had just asked me. I was in no state to be able to remember anything at that point, but I was not able to realize this myself, and the fact that I couldn't remember what he had asked me, came to be the nail in my own coffin of insanity.

The doctor and the nurse took a recession to discuss things.
When they came back, the nurse was looking at me with eyes like I was not able to comprehend anything going on around me, and told me ""I think you are feeling really bad right now, really really bad, we would like to admit you to our psychiatric ward"". Scared shitless, but in desperate need of help, I wanted to take the offer, but I have an extreme fear of being enprisoned and my freedom taken away from me, so I asked the nurse ""Are you going to lock me up? Are you going to force medication on me? Am I still free to go?"". He ensured me that I was not going to get locked up, that they couldn't force medication on me, that I was at all times free to go.
So I accepted the offer, and the nurse led me away towards the psychiatric ward.

I was calming down a bit. They were going to help me, they wouldn't lock me up, they wouldn't force me, they wouldn't take my freedom away.

At the psychiatric ward I was led to a room void of any stimuli. White walls and a single bed. Nothing else. The room was placed in something called the ""screened unit"". What that exactly meant, I was yet to find out. A new nurse took over, and told me that a new doctor from the ward would come down and talk to me in a minute, assessing my present state and evaluating my acute treatment. Then she asked to look through my things, policy. She took my keychain and the cord for my phone charger.
The new doctor arrived. Suddenly, in the presence of a person who, under these circumstances possess the ability to literally take away my freedom, I started to panic. Starting to panic I once again spoke frantically, erattic, I was so scared, everything in my body ached.
At some point the doctor stopped me, and started speaking to the nurse, about ""screening"", ""activity plans"", ""mania"". I had to know what was going on, so I asked ""Am I manic right now?"", the doctor answered ""Yes"". Okay, well, I don't know what that really even means, so I asked ""Am I psychotic"", this too he answered with a ""Yes"". Idiot, why ask that, you don't really know what it means to be psychotic either, but it does sound worse, it does sound a lot more like ""insane, will never be normal again, lost his mind"". My mind was running wild, I had to calm myself down, so I asked ""I am still free to go right, not that I am going to leave, I want to stay to get help, but I need to know that I can leave, enprisonment scares me out of my mind"". The doctor answered ""Well..."". ""Well what?? The nurse told me that you wouldn't lock me up, he promised"" now I'm really losing it. The doctor continued ""Right now, I can't let you out as It is my judgment that you are a danger to yourself and people around you"".

My world went dark. The doctor left. The nurse stayed, she had some final questions. ""Now that the doctor has made the decision that you cannot leave, you have to make a personal decision that, in the case that you act out of control and we deem you a danger to the staff, we can act in three ways, one, we can hold you down, two, we can strap you to a bed or three, we can force medication. In the event that it should be necessary, which would you prefer?""

I felt like a small child, scared, alone in the dark, so alone and so afraid, so far away from anyone who could soothe me.
It was a nightmarish paradox in my mind. I knew that if anyone tried to force me, I would react violently, in absolute fear, not insanity. But to them, the two would be indistinguishable.

I chose force medication as I thought they might have a better chance at acheving that.

The nurse left, came back with clothes from the ward, took my clothes, took all my possessions, including my phone. Gave me some pills. I wasn't there, my body was, but my mind was gone, I don't know where to, somewhere deep inside, somewhere with a faint trace of warmth, a distant memory of my mother's voice in her child's ear.

The next day, I awoke in my prison. I won't spend much time describing the next two days. I thought my life had already taught me how hell would look, but I was wrong. These two days, the longest two days of my life, I will never forget. These two days will forever be a source of my nightmares.

I didn't want to be bipolar anymore. Finally I questioned myself, I scoured my mind. I saw a pattern. Some extreme emotional incident had occurred to me, at very specific times though the past six months, and here at the psychiatric facility. I had a knife at my throat, but I realized the only way to remove that knife, was to gather myself, I needed my brain right now. Driven by the absolute certainty that my life depended on it, I gathered myself. With shaking hands, I spoke calmy, articulated, friendly and reasonable with the nurses, I asked to talk to a doctor again, and as time went, one of the nurses remarked to me that ""you don't seem manic, did the doctor say that you are manic?"". This nurse ended up getting me an acute appointment with the doctor who took away my freedom. I felt panic in my stomach, but I bottled it up.

Long story short, I had a long talk with the doctor, I argued my case, he wouldn't let me out, but he allowed me a phonecall. I called my best friend who is also a doctor, and I told him everything. Everything that I had never told him before. About my struggles, ADHD, bipolar, my admission the the psychiatric ward. I was afraid to tell him, I was afraid that he no longer would want to be my friend. On the contrary, he jumped into action right away. He called the psychiatric ward, he spoke to the doctors. Next thing I know, I am no longer locked up in the ward, I am free to come and go as I want, I got all my possessions back. The second doctor came to me and said that they would investigate, as I was clearly troubled by something, but as of now, they were unsure of the bipolar diagnosis.

Having been given my freedom, I relaxed once again, I trusted that I was now in good hands, that these people actually wanted to help me. Being calm and relaxed, as the days went by, the staff observed me and for the first time had the chance to see who I am when I am not fearing for my life.

One whole month goes by before my assessment is finally complete and I am let go, with a treatment plan and all the help that I have needed for so long.

Their final conclusion; ""you have ADHD, that one was easy. But we knew there was more than that. You have ADHD, AND you are autistic.""

My autistic way of categorising, creating protocols, systems and algorithms for everything, social interactions, cooking, doing laundry and so on, has apparently been so effective that I have been camouflaging my asperger for most of my adult life. Camouflaging it to everyone around me. But living in a world of chaos and stress myself.

I have read up on asperger and autism. I am finally home. In this, I see myself clearly, for the first time. This was the missing piece of the puzzle.

I asked if I don‚Äôt give him these things and he said he‚Äôs in love with me and I do but he was still seeking out companionship on these dating apps. I have accused him of cheating on me.

593,How are you with conflict resolution and 'difficult conversations'?,"['conversations', 'conflict', 'difficult', 'resolution']","I have had a difficult to catastrophic time with this historically, and even this year had several conversations where people were mad at me at work and after the conversation I just felt worse and they probably felt madder, but I couldn't figure out why or what they wanted or why they were so hell-bent on just rejecting me and stamping me as a big jerk who was being a jerk on purpose. It was so painful I was already formulating an exit strategy and scheming as to how to avoid 99% of social interaction at work, which probably also would have made everyone mad.

In a recent case I first spent about three months cooling off and processing my own emotions. That was probably excessive, but there was no way I could have handled it before that. Then I researched conflict resolution and identified a sequence of steps that are research-based and fairly reliable. I also mega-analyzed the situation in writing privately, identifying specifically which behaviors or statements were a problem for me, and making kind of a flow-chart of 'if hostile reaction, then x, if open reaction, then y' and wrote a few scripts.  


In the actual situation, I did not follow the steps I had researched one to one, which was good because the first step is that you affirm the other person at some length, and the person I was talking too had acted out partly because they already felt invaded, but I did get the general vibe right and stay in the framework of 'let's try to figure out a solution where we both have what we need'.   


To my surprise, it worked really well. I did not get annihilated once again, I found out what the big issue was, and while I myself never would have gotten upset about the same things, this person did and I just let that be how it is rather than questioning wtf was wrong with them to get mad at such tiny inoffensive things. I also felt better because I actually got some good information and now know what sets this person off (things I could NEVER have predicted!!!) and so am no longer stuck in a minefield.

600,I just need to vent,"['vent', 'just', 'need']","I guess it all started about 3 years ago when I successfully kickstarted my passion project. I was counting on at most 20 backers, but got over 70 and the project became much larger than I or my wife expected it to. 

The project had some custom circuit boards in it and the fabrication house made many mistakes which meant I needed to manually rework all 200 that I ordered and send them out months after the promised delivery date. I've been in contact with the fab house since then and they keep promising compensation for their mistakes, but it just seems like gas lighting at this point.

I was also going to college and working for a startup during all of this and my boss kept pushing me to pick up more hours. I finally couldn't take the pressure anymore so I quit and took a much easier job. 

Things seemed fine for a couple months then my mother-in-law was paralyzed from stage 4 cancer and my wife was the only one who could really help her mom so we moved in to take care of her. The cancer was diagnosed at the beginning of COVID lockdowns so we had to isolate to keep mil safe. At the end of 2020 mil passed away and my wife took it hard.

Fast forward to now and I only have 2 semesters left before I graduate, so I need to find a job (I have a student job at my uni that I lose when I graduate), we are expecting our second kid, and I recently became aware that I most likely have ASD. I would like an official diagnosis, but I don't have the time for anything else right now.

The part that I need to vent about is my wife has pushed me to finish repairs on the extra circuit boards from my Kickstarter, but I can't bring myself to touch them. I get so stressed even thinking about them. I also assume during all of this I must have hit autistic burnout because I sudenly have a really hard time figuring out how to annunciate in a way people can easily understand me. This has also frustrated my wife, but it's hard to talk to her about it when she can't really understand me. Because of how frustrated my wife is feeling and the communication better I've felt distant from her and since she is really my only emotional connection I've had a hard time emotionally connecting to anything that has recently happened. Which is the first time since we started dating that I have felt like this. It feels awful. The way I coped as a kid was to work on projects (this is where I learned to code and design circuit boards). Every part of me wants to isolate and work on something, but I don't have time and I want to be there for my wife especially since she is pregnant. Fighting the drive to work on projects has only made my burnout worse. I don't know if I can handle the next year.

Tldr; I got burnt out 3 years ago and partially lost my ability to talk and now I'm facing burnout again, but I don't have a way to escape the situations causing the burnout this time.",wi7a2e,4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wi7a2e/i_just_need_to_vent/

609,Ignorance is Bliss?,"['bliss', 'ignorance']","I sometimes wonder if in a weird way there are a few advantages to being more... ""fully"" autistic than to be kind of closer to the border of neurotypical. I don't meant to be insensitive, but what I'm trying to get at is some of the people with more advanced conditions may be happily oblivious about things that those with less advanced cases may have to constantly question and worry about (but still not really succeed in surmounting, which gets frustrating).

For example, I am able to pick up on a lot of things, at least sort of ""halfway"". I can read a good amount of body language, compared to some on the spectrum, but still have problems fully interpreting, or at least responding, to it effectively (more accurately I have problems connecting what I perceive in them to things I say, but more on that later). When talking to people, I am (and have been) almost hyper-attuned to little things they do. Like I notice small changes of expression on their face as I'm talking to them, such as slight frowns, puzzled looks, slight groans or sighs, looking away from time to time off in the distance as if they are bored, uncomfortable, or don't want to be there... \*but\* I have trouble actually figuring out why they would be this way, and then may second guess that I even perceived this (like I am having the same basic kind of conversation that I saw them have with someone else and they didn't seem to show these signs). I may later question whether it was even real or I am over-interpreting. Sometimes because of these signs I see in people, I lose confidence in what I'm saying, feel very self-conscious, and stop talking or become more timid and awkward. Or I may change the subject too soon out of reaction to that, but don't do it smoothly. It's almost like I'm guessing at what they would want to see next in the convo and why they may be bored or annoyed, but don't really arrive at the right conclusion most of the time. Sometimes I may try to imitate what some NT people would say to salvage the interaction, but ultimately that is just a mask (one that can work sometimes admittedly).

I think the key is I may lack a certain amount of extra context in a given interaction. Maybe they're short on time and that's why they seem like they want to get out of the discussion. Or they've already talked about this before, or it's too generic a topic, so they're bored? Maybe my own facial expressions (or lack thereof) and other body mannerisms are weirding them out somehow, or I'm not showing enough eye contact (been working on this lately though). Or I'm more monotone than I think when I speak. Could be a lot of things. Maybe I'm worrying too much about every possible dimension to this and considering too many things.

The point is, I've met more advanced autistic people and they often seem to be content in their own world, despite having their own problems with the rest of society. But they aren't as bothered by it perhaps because maybe they don't know how much they're missing. I, on the other hand, am constantly impacted by what I see as little failures of communication and the knowledge that I could maybe do things right but don't... I intellectually understand how people function socially but when it comes time to apply this in a practical way to my own life is where I often fail.

It's ironic but despite being on the spectrum, many people I know say I'm actually pretty aware and attuned to certain social dynamics and relationship aspects... just not so much ""on the spot"" when they happen, like in the middle of a conversation or at a party (like sometimes to fill in silences I say the first thing that may come to mind and instantly realize I should've have). When I have time to think about things on my own and assess them, I am able to be quite perceptive and perspicacious. I also notice what I see are blatant and sometimes funny faux pas of other Aspie or at least neurodivergent people. I question to myself, ""How could they have done something like that? That was so obvious. How did they not see that? Total cringe."" And I still get annoyed by some of their habits and other things they do. I also notice when texting someone if they have gotten bored or no longer want to continue the current discussion for whatever reason, which is more than I can say for some of my friends that just keep rapid firing text after text, seemingly without any mental feedback mechanism to tell them that maybe they should stop or slow down haha. I can pick up on body language that women often show when they are attracted, like playing with their hair, certain kinds of smiles and gazes. Got a decent degree of empathy too, I think. And when talking to people I tend to match their vibe and feed off of the energy they put out... if someone is outgoing and talks a lot, I feel good doing so as well, but if someone is introverted, shy, tired, or just uncomfortable talking much, then I feel that and the interaction tends to be kinda quiet, sometimes with some awkward tension. Unlike some Aspies who can just talk peoples heads off without noticing their discomfort. I can pass myself off, at least for a while, as a fairly normal, if somewhat quirky, person; most of the people who see the Aspie symptoms are either people who know me very well or other people on the spectrum who can relate to some things. At the same time I don't want to feel this (misplaced) sense of relative superiority either. We all have our own way that symptoms manifest through our own unique personalities, and that's what makes us each interesting; some have strengths in some areas while others in other areas.

I struggle to find what to say when walking pass by someone, should i say anything? I tend to avoid eye contact and just walk pass them but i feel like that just increases tension and ""weirdness"".
If i know the person wants to engage in socializing i have no problems, i can talk and dont have problems ""landing"" the interactions. The problem is detecting when and what is the level of interaction.

conversations have always been challenging for me. difficult, awkward, perilous, painful, not often fun.

i recently got involved with a group called Authentic Relating. they teach (IMO) how to do conversations better. How to be more authentic, more meaningful, more present, more safe. I enjoyed learning everything. It was 'oh finally, a conversation style which suits me!'

I was keen to apply my new skills to my broader life. Unfortunately I found the people I know to be  reluctant to participate. They only want to do conversations their way and don't want to follow my lead.

I am more aware now about how people don't listen to me. Aren't interested in me. Don't make space for me. Aren't present to me. It is very painful. I feel like i don't matter. I am invisible. My wants and needs aren't accommodated for.

Please do not start accusing me of sexualizing Autistic/Asperger women in all of the expressed following.  There is no such thing as Autistic/Asperger women being like-minded with their male counterparts on having sex as a special interest.  This would also include genitals, their variations, as well as fetishes.  To most Autistic/Asperger women, the subject matter of sex is disgusting, which must partially factor into why in the arena of relationships they prefer them to be platonic, which has to result from their being scarred for life by trauma from bad sexual experiences, thus they want nothing to do with sex again, and I sense this happens more often with Autistic/Asperger women than it does with their male counterparts.  There are many Autistic/Asperger men I can speak for when I say that it does not pay to possess a libido.  

My own Autistic/Asperger female friend who is my same age, it is not likely that she and I will get together for life due to the state of North Carolina being her legal guardian now, and I had a petition running for her living situation on Change.org that has only gotten as high as 596 signatures.

624,Help with aspie crush,"['aspie', 'crush', 'help']"," 

I am an NT woman in my 40s. I used to work together with an aspie guy (also in his 40s) for many years. We developped a superficial friendship, just having work lunches together with others. Three years ago he started texting me more, sending me pictures of his travels, brought me small presents. I changed workplace (same company, different site), but we kept in touch, texting every 1-3 days. He started flirting (telling me I am cute/sexy), but nothing heavy and after each time he flirted, he went silent for a while. He also told me that he is afraid that he ""does something wrong"" when flirting with me and that I should tell him if that happens.

One year ago, I developped feelings and I told him. He said that I have a false, positive idea of him and that he is much weirder than I think he is. When I asked how he feels about me, he said that he likes me a lot, but prefers to stay alone and we are just friends. Since then, every time we schedule a meeting, he cancels it. He says that he is afraid that he will disappoint me if we meet in real life. Yet, he keeps meeting and travelling with his other friends (travelling is his special interest)... so I don't think that he has social anxiety (or at least, he only has it with me).

I wanted to accept that we are just friends, but we keep texting every 1-3 days and our texts are more intimate than with my other friends. For example, when I travel he is the first to ask if I arrived ok; when I am ill, he checks on me constantly. He sends me heart emojis. I have many friends, but none of them does this; this is more like how a boyfriend would behave. This frequent and caring texting keeps me wondering if he really only sees me as a friend or he likes me more. (We are no longer teenagers... people in their 40s don't spend their days texting.)

Sometimes I think that he likes me romantically, he is just too anxious to pursue anything with me... other times, I think that he doesn't really care about me just likes the attention that I give him.

My reasoning for this is that we often get stuck with groups of higher functioning individuals whos experinces and needs don't always match ours. Yes our symptoms are similar to each other and Whatever side of the spectrum you're on you can probably relate to each other. But there are still things about moderate and severe that people on the higher functioning and don't have experience with and can't relate with leaving many of us outcasted. 
 Some of them might use ACCs full time or part time and want to talk about their struggles regarding this. 
Others may have grown up or still are in special education and wish to have a easier time finding people who relate. Others may have care givers and want to express their concerns or feeling regarding it.  So many of these communities are built and will help you no matter what and that's great. But it is so hard to find people in those communities who are moderate to severe or who have the experienced one or more of the above In a way that they can relate. 
That's frustrating, So I want to build a community for those people but at the same time I don't have any help. I'm afraid that I'm going to get attacked because people don't understand why I would want to make a separate community for moderate and sever autistics.  Then There is the fact that I don't know what to call this without offending people. 
And not having any friends to help me start a group, Not knowing where to ask or what to do. What do you think? Would you be interested is this something you like the sounds of?

My boyfriend says he coddles my feelings too much and i am genuinely looking for clarity. 
Sometimes i ask him if he would say things a little differently and he gets upset and says i am not allowing him to have his own identity (by me asking he says things differently).

Example: we were outside at a coffee shop and i was taking selfies of us. The lighting was AMAZING and i thought i looked so good. I have struggled with insecurity about looks most my life. On days i feel pretty i like to milk it. I showed him the selfie and half jokingly said ‚Äúwowww am i not the most stunning woman ever? Do you feel lucky to have such a stunning human as your girlfriend?‚Äù His response was ‚Äústop drawing so much attention to yourself that is very narcissistic.‚Äù This caught me off guard and i asked if he was being serious? He said yes and went on about how i can come across as narcissistic.

Whenever we get into a heated arguement he calls me a narcissist. I have spent way too much time on google over the last year learning about narcissism and i genuinely dont think that is what i am. When he isnt angry i ask him if he truely thinks im a narcissist and he says no. I am a sensistice person and it hurts my feelings when he calls me that.

I mentioned i dont like whn he calls me that and if he could find a different way to convey his message which upsets him. He says i am not allowing him to have his own identity and that he coddles me to much. I suggest that we need to work on communication but he says i need to work on comprehension because he is communicating clearly.

I say anxiety and I‚Äôm sure anxiety is there but I can do still. I try to focus on breath and all that.

So yesterday my boss went on a tirade about how the task was taking too much time, essentially deriding my performance, etc. etc...I replied by stating the fact that the work was done long ago from my end, that the mistake was on their end for handing me an outdated file, no lie there...

What was their reply? That *I should've known.* How? Because if I was more involved in the office, I would've noticed that that was the case - a task that I was only handed at that moment and given an incorrect file for BY THEM...Yet somehow it is still my fault?

663,I suspect some of our social challenges come from us being more conscious than others about fake/insincere interactions.,"['social', 'interactions', 'insincere', 'conscious', 'fake']","General interactions with people seem to follow social protocols that involve a lot of pretence. People are so often performatively affectionate even when they don't like each other, and perhaps due to conditioning most people don't seem to feel hyperaware of or bothered by the hypocrisy of these instances.

I am acutely aware of every interaction in which I am forced by social rules to pretend and perform something I do not actually feel.

I suspect a lot of the words we commonly use to describe our autistic experience (feeling like an imposter, performing, playing a role, masking, etc.) aren't just descriptions of what autistics do. They're descriptions of what everyone does but is unbothered by. We feel the dissonance acutely and therefore look for the words to describe this extremely unsettling experience.

It's not necessarily that others do not mask; it's that having to mask hurts our sense of integrity.

(Of course I am aware that masking is sapping for other reasons as well, but I found my above-described epiphany about perception of honesty rather interesting.)

665,Long vents on my symptoms of potential ASD...,"['asd', 'symptoms', 'vents', 'long', 'potential']","Hi everyone. I've (30M) always struggled with my mental health, especially in the form of anxiety, depression and lots of social anxiety/avoidant personality. However, I've managed to do okay. Although extremely anxious and avoidant at times, I can survive social situations, even enjoy them if I'm in the right mood (and maybe drinking), and in some occasions even look for them. I've done well in school/work - I have a PhD and I'm working as a researcher at a University. I have a boyfriend for 8 years and we really are pretty well - I think that because I never thought I'd be in this position and someone would love me, I've made an effort for this relationship to work well.

That, of course, is what you would see from the outside. Inside, my head is a mess. I always toyed with the idea that I might be in the spectrum, but neve really believed it as I was definitely not stereotypical. Now, we now that has changed and some time ago I was thinking about famous people that have started to be diagnosed with mild ASD, and still look completely neurotypical. How can these people be autistic if they're comedians or actors and they're always on interviews, dealing with people and, I assume, without much stimming or repetitive behaviours because otherwise it would have been noticed before? Suddenly, when I read about it, I started to put together many many things about my life, especially some memories or stories my parents loved to jokingly tell everyone (to show what a bad boy I was as a child) that now seem really autistic... I seem to have most of the social traits of ASD, but I would say I don't really have much of the sensory or behavioural traits. In fact, if I look at the DSM5 I would say I fulfil criterion A but maybe not B. But again, seeing how ASD is so diverse and my perception is definitely biased, I might be wrong.

I'm not looking for a diagnosis, only to share my experience and maybe get some opinions from people who might feel identified or not. I started to make this exercise where I would note down any ""weird trait"" I noticed about myself and almost every single time, after googling, I'd found is actually really common among autistic people. So here's my list (incomplete, as there were stuff that I didn't have anything to write them on and then forgot):

**During childhood:**

\- Problems eating: when I was about 2, I spent a week without wanting to eat absolutely anything. My parents were going insane. After a week, when they asked me in despair what I wanted to eat I said something (some kind of soup from my country) and I only ate that for 9 months straight (they would put all sorts of stuff into the broth so I would be healthy). And still it was hard, everything was about me eating, everybody needed to stop what they were doing to feed me or I'd get distracted or puke. Obviously I don't remember any of this, but I've heard this story so many times from so many people!

\- When I was older I ate better, but almost always the same kinds of food and I didn't want to try new stuff at all. This changed after I was like 20, when I suddenly started to try new stuff.

\- When I was about 2-3 and they were taking me to kindergarten, there was a street where I had to walk on the end of the pavement, balancing myself, all the way til the end. If I fell down, we had to stop from the beginning of the road. We were late so often because of this and I've also heard this story so many times because it'd drive my mother crazy.

\- In general, I was completely stubborn and I always had to get away with my ways. (But this is normal in many people, right?). I would have lots of tantrums if things didn't go like I wanted. E.g. I would kick a friend out of my house if he won me at a game. I once cancelled a trip that I organised with some friends to one of my relative's country house because they were late (I was about 15).

\- In general, I've always been told that I'm weird.

\- I've always felt that I was playing a role. This especially in adulthood, it's always present in my mind.

\- I've always found extremely difficult doing new things. I don't have a problem with routine at all, I like doing things outside of my routine to not get bored, but when I have to do something that I've never done before I blank. For instance, start a new hobby, cut my hair, wear a different style of clothes... things that people would notice (when I manage to start a new hobby, I tell nobody about it. Almost nobody knows the real me in that sense). It took me so so much to find the strength to do thins like: start jogging, joining a gym, eat alone in a restaurant, go to the cinema alone... This type of new things I could only do if I had the help or input with someone that'd do them with me (but without explicitly asking), to not feel weird while doing them alone.

\- Black and white thinking. For instance, if I had a fight with a friend about the smallest of things, for me the friendship was over and I had completely fucked up. It didn't seem possible for it to recover.

\- I constantly bit and still bite my nails. Didn't think this was anything important but I've now realised this is considered also stimming and could be a behavioural trait? Since so many people do it, I didn't think further, but maybe this is how I learnt to cope with my anxiety.

**Adulthood:**

\- I have Alexithymia. I've learnt this is very common in ASD people. I went to a psychologist for 1.5 years a couple of years ago, and although it didn't help particularly, it helped me realise this and we would work with one of those emotion wheels to try and figure out my mind. (BTW, he wasn't the type of psychologist that would diagnose you, only focused on treating with CBT and stuff).

\- I take some things very literally. I really struggle with things like ""let's take a coffee sometime"" or suggesting doing a trip and getting replies like ""yesss let's do it"", but actually never doing it. Once that's said, I basically start making plans in my mind. It baffles me how easily people forget about these things the promised, while I always remember them, because for me, they're real.

\- I imitate people, especially for instance their writing style in WhatsApp and similar (I mostly communicate with people online). I ""laugh"" completely different with people depending on how they laugh (with emoticons, with xD, with hahaha, or even other ways). I imitate how they speak on WhatsApp. I panic in the weird scenario in which two people with whom I interact differently with are in the same group. The same happens in real person (although not as obvious), I behave differently with different people - I've always thought I have different personalities depending on the group. I HATE mixing ""social groups"", when I end up hanging out with people that don't know each other and only know me in common. I don't know how to act, my different personalities mix. That's why I've never organised a birthday for myself or stuff like that were you'd invite lots of different people. And I really DON'T understand how some people like it.

\- I just realised it might sound like I'm very social, but I actually can't keep friendships. I had a best friend as a teenager, but I realised some time ago that he wasn't really my best friend, only ""the best"" of the ones I had. I suffered a lot of emotional abuse from ""friends"" during those times, but I won't get into that. After that, I've really really struggled to make friends. I would be friendly with people, sometimes hang around, but they always seemed to think I didn't have interest because of how I behaved and my anxiety/avoidance, and ended up losing them. I've recently in the last 2-3 years made what I would say is my first best friend. He's amazing and patience and sympathetic with all of my faults, but I have so many difficulties communicating.

\- I obsess sometimes with things or people, but not to the extent of the typical autistic person. I don't have a very strong interest, although my interests are very scattered. In my academic career I've been interested in so many different stuff that most people think I'm way too disperse. I've literally touched almost every field of research without focusing on one in particular because my interests keep switching. But I also obsess with people, e.g., with my best friend, obsessing with what he's doing, if he'll tell me later (getting sad if he doesn't share stuff with me), checking if he answered my texts, if he's online...

\- I still have black and white thinking. My best friend told me many times. One sentence can completely throw me off balance and I think he doesn't like me anymore, he doesn't want to be my friend, that I've fucked up forever, etc., etc.,

\- I force myself a lot, but generally can't really look people in the eye when I speak, but I've improved a lot. I can't remember how it was when I was a child, but this thought has always been in my head, so I guess I always had the problem?

\- I have meltdowns/shutdowns when my emotions are too strong (usually negative ones) and I can't understand them because of my alexithymia. I really just shut down, CAN'T talk to anyone, look anyone in the eye, if I managed to speak is in a super monotonous voice and barely audible. This can last hours, days, depends... I make my boyfriend really suffer with this because he doesn't know what to do. This can happen out of the smallest thing, sometimes I don't even know why.

\- I sometimes have problems understand what some people want to say and I ask explanation for every detail. Especially with my best friend, I feel like I have to ask clarification for every single thing he says because I'm not sure I understood. People don't usually ask for clarifications as much as me, I'm not sure if they just go along with it and don't ask for things they didn't understood, or they always understand everything. I wouldn't say I'm like CONSTANTLY not understanding stuff, but I feel I do it more than other people do it to me at least.

\- I go into too much detail (LOL CAN YOU TELL), I can't really focus on the ""big picture"" very easily. For instance, when I write emails at work they're always very long and with lots of details and I really really try to cut them down and takes me a long time, but everything seems important. Also, for me it's very important that they read the email in that order, that the information comes in the way that I wanted to say it. If I imagine that they're going to skim through the email and read it by chunks I get super nervous, because that's not how it was supposed to be read.

\- When I'm more comfortable with a person, I don't know where are the limits to ask about some things or not. It makes me very uncomfortable to ask about some things, but I don't know if I should be doing it. With my best friend, for instance, I feel like I was way too much, and I stretch the limits.

\- I practice a lot how conversations are going to go with people, like a lot.

\- I'm almost always on time and I really don't understand people who are always extremely late, i really don't. I get super annoyed when this happens and this black and white thinking comes. Once with my best friend, he was 45 min late (because of a misunderstanding he thought I was leaving late too) and that produced a huge shutdown for me, I could not speak a word in all the time we hanged, and I had to suddenly leave the restaurant where we were and leave him alone.

\- I don't understand at all some social stuff and why people feel emotionally about some things. For instance, the obsession with weddings and being their special day, the toxicity about forming a family, the possession in relationships and the kind of stuff people consider ""cheating"", celebrating birthdays, graduations, etc. I really can't emphasise with any of that in books or movies, I just don't get it why it's so important.

\- I don't really have a problem with set phrases I think, but there just a couple I do have lots of problems. I don't know if this is significative or it's normal to have a couple you just don't get.

\- As I said before, I always feel like playing a role. I'm actually I think pretty good at my job - although I hate the social aspect, I just deal with it. I'm good communicating in writing, writing stuff, and even presenting orally at conferences. I've always felt that I put a mask: on the one hand it's the ""professional me"" and then there's the ""real me"". The professional me is even charming and can deal with professional matters really well, even if they are social. But switch into leisure mode and I completely panic. I hate the small talk that happens before a meeting (I'm always a bit late to meetings on purpose to avoid it) and when work colleagues want to be friendly. But nobody knows anything about me besides my professional self. I could never participate in a debate or give my opinion in public about something, but I can pretty much discuss any academic matter.

\- I HATE vague questions like ""how are you?"" when they are asked as a real question, not politely as a greeting. My best friend does this a lot, my psychologist used to start sessions like that. I just DON'T KNOW how to answer that. I always say fine, I never elaborate. I just DON'T KNOW HOW TO ELABORATE. I can't stress enough how strong I feel this ""not knowing how"". Same with yes/no questions. If you ask me one of those questions, I'll ask with yes or no, full stop. I need very precise questions to be able to elaborate on something, and I still takes me a couple of seconds to put my thoughts together and start answering (unless I've prepared it in my mind). (I've been told many times by people that I always answer with fine/yes/no to everything, so it's not only my impression). I also COMPLETELY HATE questions that people ask when they want to get to know you like ""what's your favourite movie"", ""what kind of music do you listen to"". I really hate it, I feel like i can't share that information with people because it's giving out too much information about me (which is the point I guess). But also like I don't even have a favourite movie or book, I can't make that type of decision.

\- I have lots of problems making decisions in general (also been told by many people). I can spend an hour walking past a lot of restaurants, trying to decide which one to go in to eat (alone). I did this just last week. If I need to book a flight or a hotel, I can spend days browsing options and not deciding over the most minimal things, like: maybe it's better to take the return flight at 5 pm or later at 7 pm? I waste so much energy that prices always go up and the decision ends up being made by itself (e.g. one of the flights is now much more expensive).

\- Now I'm not much of a picky eater, and I didn't consider the following to be weird, but I've seen people treat it as an autistic trait. Many people say they can't eat certain foods because of the texture. I've never really thought about the texture of things, so I don't know if this applies to me? But when thinking about it, I'm not much of a meat eater because I can't stand how certain parts of meat feel in my mind, e.g., the cartilage part of chicken or pork, it really makes me want to puke sometimes. I CAN'T STAND the smell of tuna (in a can), it fills the room, I can't stand it, makes me want to puke. I can't also stand cold or cured meats, I don't know why, it's a combination of the smell, the looks, the texture and the taste (but I'll eat it if there's nothing else). I never thought these things were weird, I would have never put it as ""I can't stand certain textures because my senses are too strong"". But I don't know if I'm simply undervaluing things.

What do you think? Most of these things always looked more like quirks to me. Some are really impairing in my life, and I just thought ""that's who I am"" and related it to my social anxiety/avoidant personality/alexithymia. But put together, does it make sense as ASD, even if I don't have problems with behavioural aspects, routines, obsessions with topics, etc.?

I have had many people in my life who have ASD (I think I may seek out friendships with people who have intense interests, because I do too!

I absolutely love listening to him talk about his interests, and I am never bored for a second listening to these subjects he is so knowledgeable about! However-- I have trouble talking about my own intense interests. I'm always afraid of boring him. I feel like I know everything about him, haha, but I don't know if he really knows that much about me. How can I tell if I am boring him when I talk about myself?

In a meeting you're expected to respond immediately, yet I'm not even done processing all the stuff that has been said so far. I don't understand how people do it.

My wife has severe rejection sensitive dysphoria. Multiple times throughout the day she'll apologize for her words or actions and I usually respond with a very confused, ""for what?"" I never understand why she's apologizing, but she says it's because she thinks she's bothering me in some way. I have to constantly reassure her that she's not a burden or bothering me. 

She also freaks out if I don't give her lots of attention. Last week she accused me of just using her for sex because I went on my phone after we had sex. We've been together for nearly twenty years, so that threw me. I have to give her constant reassurance that I'm not going to leave her.

I know she needs a lot of love and reassurance. The problem is that I run out of spoons for this very quickly. I'm not very good at expressing my feelings (big shock, I know), and having to dote on her all the time to make her feel safe is difficult.

There is 10M job openings, and this is to  include min wage jobs where you need to work 3 or 4 jobs to barely get  by. Prior virus there was an average of 5M-6M opening. 

&#x200B;

  
The math flat out shows, there is far more unemployed than jobs out there.  

&#x200B;

(This is in the USA BTW)

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

Note for those not in the know. The unemployment numbers media and gov in the USA pushes isn't true unemployment numbers. It only counts those on the unemployment program, and in many cases the numbers are adjusted.

Like most don't know this, but if you are unemployed for over 6 months, then you are automatically kicked off from being on the program and you aren't counted. If you never went on it, maybe you were rejected or didn't try due to stigma. You aren't counted. If you do something like cut grass for next door and make $200 to help you pay for food or whatever. Then you aren't counted. I can keep going, but I think most can get my point.

&#x200B;

# There is even things like  Bureau of Labor Statistics detailed, survey-takers misclassified a lot of people‚Äîaround 5 million‚Äîas employed but absent from work, rather than unemployed on temporary¬†layoff. 

&#x200B;

Real quick because it isn't straight forward. Why I added underemployed is because the following is what is considered

* Skilled workers in low-paying jobs
* Skilled workers in low-skill jobs
* Part-time workers preferring fulltime
* You can be unemployed and still counted as underemployed. The cutting grass for someone next door is an example of this.

Generally these are the people that are actively looking in the job market (so job openings 100% count), and many of these people they get paid just enough to live paycheck to paycheck, or they get paid below that and they are in debt or have to take several jobs. 

Most are now labeling underemployment as the new unemployment because they are finding themselves simply not able to afford the basics even while being employed.",wgnou6,4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wgnou6/for_anyone_finding_it_hard_to_getkeep_a_job_i/

As years pass, I begin to realize that she isn't interested in divulging in conversation that isn't ""pleasant"" to her. I quickly realized that that category included most aspects of my life. At first I felt like it was only around other people, but when I took my conversations private, they would still be mitigated/minimized and she would move on to something else surface level.

All of this is in contrast to how she generally texts me. I get periodic texts checking up on my well being, and saying how deeply she cares about me and my feelings, which is what makes the next part so difficult for me.

To summarize, I didn't find out definitively until a few months ago that I was diagnosed with Aspergers in 2003, at the age of 6, and the diagnosis was hidden from me until now. It was so painful and freeing and enlightening because it was the first time in my life that I felt like I could be understood. Before the diagnosis, I had agreed to being a bridesmaid to Renee's wedding, in hopes that we have misunderstood each other and that we could become closer friends. 

These last few months have been horribly taxing but I have felt a lot of growth. Through my psych and therapy I have alleviated a lot of anxiety, especially in relation to my trauma, but have also realized that my limitations are different than they were when I was a masking 10 year old sitting in a college class. Given that, I relayed to Renee that I get overstimulated easily in large groups of people, and that I have Aspergers, in case that aids our communication. 

Renee invites me to her Bachelorette party, saying it will just be us girls. Based on what she told me, that totaled 6 people. I walk in- 43 place settings. Music. Talking. Banging. Yelling. Barking. Every noise I could imagine, piercing my ears and filling me with so much anxiety I feel like I'm going to implode. I was so painfully overstimulated. Then, she walked up and refused to stop talking to me. I lasted 50 minutes and it f-ed me up so bad I didn't sleep until 3 am. That was enlightening. 

I took a few days to think on it, and told her 'Hey, I understand that this was also on me for not asking guest count, but I can't do things like that. I get overstimulated and talking makes it significantly worse.   I need to remove myself from the bridal party as to not embarrass you or myself if it's all going to be this crazy'. Her response was 'I get that you have anxiety and all but  that's not a good reason on changing your mind from the answer you gave me a few months ago. I'm really hurt, especially because someone else pulled out of the wedding. I'm sure we can repair this though. I hope you find healing.'

WE? We can repair this? I lost it. To get my Aspergers and overstimulation reduced to a bit of anxiety hurts so badly. And to say that she hopes I find healing... healing what, Aspergers? Jesus. I responded in the nicest way possible that she doesn't dislike my trauma, she dislikes my Aspergers, and that I'm stepping away from the friendship. 

I'm tired, the act of making friends feels absolutely hopeless as an ND adult.",wgh98a,6,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wgh98a/lost_my_only_friend_and_im_furious/

697,Can't communicate with anyone,['communicate'],"As time passes I've noticed I have harder and harder time getting along with people. 10 years ago I could at least get a reasonable conversation going for a day, keep contact for up to 3 months tops. Nowadays it's a miracle, once in a month event if I can get a \~1 hour conversation. I'm fairly confident I'm scarred due to internet culture of abandonment, where you see a person, instantly judge them and cut contact based on first message, especially from girls. Due to spending 10 years in this environment I have also developed this type of behavior, where if a person isn't at least somewhat promising, I lose interest instantly. Can't really help it, except forcing myself to spend time together, but at this point it becomes painful to have any type of interaction, every moment I beg for the interaction to end. On the other hand I constantly yearn for human interaction due to the need to feel validated and loved (which I only started to feel those 10 years ago). I hate ghosting people but it's become normal for me if I don't see the other person as enjoyable to talk with or valuable. On the other hand, I get the same type of treatment from those I (rarely) DO find enjoyable and want to hang out with. I don't know how to break this cycle so at this point I mostly post these to pretend that I'm trying to fix my life, but in reality I'm just whining and not doing anything constructive.

I don't know if it's depression, panic attacks, terror attacks, dysthymia or some other nonsense. If you want to talk, play games or something feel free to let me know, maybe I won't ghost you. For the most part I've already accepted my fate as a ""piece of shit"" and just want to be understood. I don't want any of that uplifting nonsense, that only worked the first 5 times I heard it. After 200 times it's just boring and annoying. People pretend to help, but in reality won't spend more than 1 hour of their time.

Also I'd post more about my situation but I'm fairly certain TOS forbid those and I'd get judged heavily.

714,Dysfunctional Dating Pattern,"['dating', 'dysfunctional', 'pattern']","I'm 43 years old, male, pretty self-aware/high functioning, but I have a dysfunctional(?) dating pattern that I want to break. This is the cycle (and please forgive the lengthy post):

1. Feeling lonely. Want an anchor partner (either a monogamous girlfriend or a non-monogamous main partner - I'm open to either).
2. Get on the apps and start dating someone with whom I have initial compatibility with.
3. Work through early anxiety (""give it a fair chance"").
4. Things feel pretty good, or at least workable: ""I can roll with this at least for a while and see where it goes - it's got a lot of good stuff."" or sometimes ""This is great - I could really see this becoming a long partnership."" Maybe I even feel like I might love the other person after a few months.
5. Slowly but surely, things feel less and less good: I feel more negatively triggered and/or critical toward my partner, whether it be doubts about how physically attracted I am, their personality quirks irritating me, or a sexual connection that's not as consistently great or exciting as I would like. (Sexual connection for me is usually a bridge to emotional connection.)
6. Keep trying to work through the difficulties, but eventually it gets to be so stressful and there's so little joy that I just give up and break it off, even though my partner is in love with me and wants to continue the relationship. (Usually less than a year.)

Around #5 and #6 above, there's a great deal of confusion as to what's going on with my feelings: 

* I don't think the person I'm dating is doing anything wrong or really different, but the relationship starts to drain me, sometimes to the point of autistic burnout (usually shutting down, sometimes melting down).
* Being with or thinking about my partner, I experience high levels of distress, confusion, aversion, anxiety. I can't seem to access how I really \*feel\* about the other person - I just feel this pervasive feeling of ""bad"" (possibly a fight or flight response) and want it to stop, so I cut the other person off as kindly as I can manage just to make it stop, without developing any real insight.
* I feel terrible that something that felt so promising devolves into something mostly painful and overwhelming. Bad for myself, and bad for what these seemingly uncontrollable feelings are doing to my partner. It feels even \*worse\* if my partner is being patient and understanding because they're being so loving, and I am just sucking them dry with my endless doubt, only to break up in the end.

It's worth noting that for most of the people I've been through this pattern with, I don't want to get back with any of them. When I look back on these relationships, I usually feel like I tried my best, but we just aren't compatible for the long haul.

I'm desperate for some insight. Despite years of therapy and self-work resulting in significant positive changes in other aspects of my life, this pattern still has me bedeviled. I would like to know:

* Has anyone experienced this pattern in themselves or a partner or a friend?
* How were you/they able to find a way out of it?
* Was it something you/they changed about yourself/themselves, or did you realize it was a square peg/round hole situation and changed what you/they were looking for? If the latter, what type of unusual arrangement(s) did you made that made relationships sustainable? (Solo-poly dating has been suggested to me.)

I'm currently in the bad part of the cycle with a partner who could not be more understanding, but I'm nearing my breaking point (as is she). I'm back in therapy now. I made a mistake by not re-starting it earlier, but better late than never (and will continue even if we don't make it).

I've been reflecting on this lately and its been an accusation I've dealt with since I'm little.

The funny thing i feel deeply for people, especially those that are close to me and try to show them that to the best of my abilities. I feel for the homeless, the refugees and sometimes I wish people would care about social justice, the environment as much as I do( I really hope I don't sound like I'm humble bragging about myself). I wish the world was more compassionate towards each other.  Like there's a lot going on emotionally and I can enter someones world and be intuned with them.  Listening to people's stories can make me(with effort of course) understand their world and understand their POV emotionally. I'm a deeply emotional and sensitive person at heart( something I sometimes wish wasn't the case.)

However, when I'm angry, I  can say the most vicious things, make them cry, and be very cold as a result. Especially when I feel like at that moment I'm right and that the person is overreacting.I also sometimes come across as emotionally detached and not reacting in ways people usually react. 

Plus in many scenarios, I might come across a certain way. Especially when I don't react the best way when someone needs it( a friend was excited about something, I decided to try and help them out by suggesting that they be realisitc, the friend got pissed and said I bummed them out.)

I blame this partially on emotional detachment I have when I'm little due to several trauma's in my life. Either way people seem to see me a certain way, even when I've helped them many times over and show my genuine care.

I was so confused why my body was shivering uncontrollably.

On other rare occasions, I woke up super early gasping for air and couldn't breathe. Like to the point I literally fell out of my bed on all fours desperate to breathe. No emotional/mental racing during this time.

On other rare occasions, I woke up super early with sharp pain in my chest that wouldn't go away for at least 10min. My heart would race for the first 30seconds. No emotional/mental anguish during this time.

The only commonality across all these moments of unexplainable and sudden physical pain was that I was experiencing multiple friendship breakups at once. But I didn't feel much emotional and mental pain. I felt emotionally and mentally shitty for maybe the first 1-2 months. And pretty much continued on with my life actively. And then 8 months ish later that's when all these random never before experienced physical pains started happening.

I saw a doctor and they said these are basically symptoms of panic attacks.

And I will say after I gave more time to release uncaught mental/emotional pain, the symptoms did go away.

My question is, is there anyone else here who only experiences physical pain from anxiety/panic attacks? I found it odd that I was so detached from my emotions that I had no clue these were symptoms of psychological duress as opposed to biological.

I make a record of all food confiscated and disposed of and give a copy to anyone in violation.  I have had roommates who seem like they could have ASD or some other similar issue and they have said things like they ""felt bad"" because they thought no one would buy it and it would be thrown away, failing to grasp that they should allow it to be thrown away and not potentially die over literally $2 worth of food.  It seems like a very odd idea, like magical thinking is involved, and it's quite dangerous.  I find it mind blowing that someone ""feeling bad"" over a can not getting bought and thrown out is worth anyone risking their life over.  It's literally a danger to oneself.  What's wild are the people who get upset over it.  If I see potentially tainted food while looking for spoiled food, I'm not ignoring it.  Don't buy a can that's folded in half with a giant crease on the rim because you're worried that no one else will buy it and it will be thrown away.

740,Dealing with other ND people,"['nd', 'people', 'dealing']","Hi,

I work in academia and had a really bad day the day before yesterday. I gave a presentation and after two minutes a member of the audience just interrupted me in a very rude manner. He started pushing his strong opinions about notational ""suggestions"" towards me. Other than that there was no apparent reason or question for him to ask. I took it as disrespectful, and replied probably also in a rude manner, which basically blew off into a kind of ""intellectual"" bullying game from his side. 

So here's the thing. I know I am autistic, and in situations like that I basically have a binary choice. I either concentrate on the intellectual demanding content and let loose of all my masking abilities or I do concentrate on my ""manners"" and completely loose my train of thought resulting in me ultimately ""loosing"" the intellectual (in this case utterly useless) ""battle"". The person who did interrupt me never came out to me as ND, but it is a very safe bet, that he also lacks communicational skills. He's the type of highly gifted intellectual highflyer who is also immensely rude to others. Unfortunately, this is ""usual"" behavior in academia and deemed as a normal thing you have to learn to deal with. Guess what I can not deal with it. So how do you deal with other ""brethren"" supposedly suffering from the same condition as you, but come out as extremely rude and disrespectful and making you feel like the idiot in the room? How do you deal with real-live Sheldon Coopers? I know they're supposedly ""like me"" but nevertheless they make academic live a living hell for me with my condition.

This is because I was in a community for several months, where we all shared arts about a comic and also about our characters. I did the same, but also wanted to interact with others and make friends with them since their art seemed (and still seems) great. That brought me problems for me, since my self-esteem and encouragement lowered when I saw how their art was better than mine despite the fact that I was trying to improve, and I thought that my interaction with them caused them discomfort, since they did not respond to my messages.

In addition, I made many mistakes on there, since I've published things that were not allowed, without knowing that they were so or by accident. That last one, caused me to be kicked out of there.

For that reason, I feel like I'm a weirdo and an idiot who doesn't learn his mistakes. Obviously, I know it's nonsense, that anyone can do that, and that I can work and improve it to be someone better, but I keep having those thoughts that don't allow me to progress.

743,I am not good at handling conflicting situations.,"['conflicting', 'situations', 'handling', 'good']","Context: I (22,F) grew up in a very emotionally unstable household. My parents had a strenuous marriage, and there was always a lot of fighting, yelling and underlying tensions. My father was short-tempered and his anger outbursts were always unpredictable, while my mother was hard to please and super critical of every tiny thing. Basically, my sibling and I have had to learn to avoid and tip-toe around the house. We both have anxiety issues. 

Now that I am dealing with real-life situations as an adult, I am realising how bad I am at dealing with conflict. 

Every time I hear or feel anger or tension escalating around me, my anxiety spikes. If someone raises their voice at me, I feel overwhelmed. Even if I am in a different room, and I hear my partner or someone I know arguing, I start to feel anxious.

My entire body freezes up if I have to confront someone. I can do it eventually, and I have done it when needed, but the experience is harrowing. 

I don't feel in control, and I can barely contain my anger. I don't become aggressive, but my words become sharper and harsher than intended. I am afraid of saying something that might actually make the situation worse.

Any advice on how to get better at handling such situations would be very helpful.

I've learned to be social its best to be yourself and not really care how you're perceived (to an extent). Don't take things to seriously either. I find most conversations I have things said mostly go over peoples heads and is forgotten next encounter. Most people just talk bs just to make conversation.
I still don't like parties, I still avoid customers in public mostly. Don't have many friends at all. I feel slightly anxious when talking to random people for extended periods of time but on the most part I like to think I appear completely normal (emphasis on appear). I know what subjects to talk about and what ones to avoid, if someone changes the subject I don't return to the previous one as that normally means they're not keen on that subject.

750,Is it possible to have Aspergers in just one area?,"['aspergers', 'possible', 'area', 'just']","My daughter was easily stimulated as a toddler, which would send her into a tantrum, sometimes for 2 hours - until she took a nap. She also had an aversion to snuggling most of the time, but not always. She was also musically gifted, where she could hear a song once, then play it on her toy piano at age 2. She she could sketch something perfectly, as well.

Other than that, she doesn't have the typical signs of Aspergers, but she has this one quirk that annoys others and causes her a lot of distress.

Example: When she was about 6, she learned to tell time as it appears digitally, e.g. ""10:45."" One time she asked me what time it was and I said ""Quarter to 11."" She didn't know what that meant because she never learned ""Quarter to 11."" Instead of just telling she didn't know what that meant, here's how the conversation would go:

Her: ""No. What time is it?""

Me. ""Quarter to 11""

Her: ""No. What time is it?""

Me: ""I just told you, quarter to 11.

""Her (getting more and more upset). ""No! What time is it?""

On and on this went until I finally figured out that she simply hadn't learned what ""Quarter to 11"" meant and finally said 10:45,

She was capable of saying, ""I don't know what quarter to 11 means,"" but she just couldn't bring herself to do it. She had to repeat the same question until I got it right. She did the same thing with her teacher.

Fast forward to today (she's 30, now).

She messaged me a payment history of money she's made on a side-hustle for the past year. No mention of what it was for, though.

Me: ""Is that from trading stocks?""

Her: ""No.""

End of discussion unless I reply, ""Well, what is it from?"" If I don't ask, she won't tell me, but she will get upset if I don't ask.

It's like a perfectionistic control thing, but she swears she can't help it. She thinks it's OCD or Aspergers, but she doesn't really have the other signs of those conditions.

She told me if her boyfriend moves something in the apartment, but doesn't move it back, it bugs the heck out of her, but she can't bring herself to move it back.

If her boyfriend leaves for work without closing his bedroom window, she won't close it even if it's raining all over his bed. She hates herself for not being able to close it, but she just can't do it, because he should've done it. If he texts her to close it, she can do it.

She wasn't Autistic but stood out because she was such a colourful character, dressed in bright provocative and flattering outfits, had a lot of male attention and generally was a very independent character who insisted on doing her own thing.

She was made such an outcast that she couldn't even find a job and was struggling to put food on the table. She didn't have any friends, women spat at her on the street and slandered her behind her back.

There's so much a person can take. She left for a while, and when she came back, she was wearing the same brown-grey ill-fitting clothes that other women wore and looked dull and devoid of any personality. All her spark was gone. She looked a broken woman and much older than her age.

Then suddenly women started talking to her and show friendliness and interest. It was the most sad thing in all this story.

Monica talked in her interviews how she always stood out in a small town where she was born and how people around never forgave her wanting to be herself, be different. She said leaving this town was the best thing that happened to her. All her massive success later on would not have been possible if she stayed longer.

It get worse if i am overwhelmed, I end up regulating my overwhelming by either touching things and complimenting them.. Or if it is a crowded place i end up telling myself : humans, humans.. Humans..(LOUDLY) 

I do that to help me navigate through the overwhelming feeling of being surrounded by a lot of things, or to navigate through a crowd..

The issue is the public can be ruthless about it. They can be unkind and judge me.

SO, How do you sensor yourself in bc public? How do you at least manage to be through a crowded place without using loud verbal signals to ease your mind? 

P. S, im sorry if my english isn't clear. It is my Second language..",wf1pfj,14,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wf1pfj/how_do_you_sensor_and_not_talk_to_yourself_loudly/
755,Advice On Handling A Neighbor With Asperger‚Äôs,"['asperger', 'neighbor', 'advice', 'handling']","Hello

I am a farmer and so is my neighbor who has Asperger‚Äôs. We farm some of his land for our own profit, as well as work back and forth trading equipment and labor. 

He is very particular on his methods of farming, and sometimes it seems like he want to do it his way even though my brother and I technically have 2/3 of the vote on how we would like to plant and harvest. 

He has lived alone and been a bachelor his whole life and worked on his own until he decided to work with us. We are 27/28 and he is 58, so with the age difference I feel as if he thinks he knows best because of his experience and sometimes it comes as confirmation bias and doesn‚Äôt always have the outcome that he thinks will happen. 

I feel like I have a pretty good relationship with him as I am the main contact. I‚Äôm looking for some pointers on how to connect with him on a level that I can understand him better. I feel that I already do, but sometimes in the heat of the moment with spring and fall work fighting with bad weather and other delays, I get frustrated and impatient with him. He is a pretty patient person until he wants something done, then he also can become impatient just like I do. 

The main things I‚Äôm asking how to handle are:

-Working with him together, sometimes it‚Äôs a one way street in terms of being ‚Äúhis way or the highway‚Äù

-How to voice my appreciation for the help he provides for us, although I try to tell him every time I get the chance

-when he stutters and has problems with pronouncing words or using the wrong terms, is it better to break eye contact with him when he‚Äôs trying to speak? I am an eye contact person but do not want him to feel uncomfortable or intimidated

-when discussing farm planning or other business with him, he talks over me a lot and interrupts to add his thoughts or opinions on things like he just has to get it out right then and there. Even if I keep talking when it‚Äôs my turn, he continues to talk over me until I stop talking. What is the best way to mitigate this?

Despite all of this, he is a very fair and knowledgeable person. I always have in mind that he may sometimes think this behavior is just the way it should be. I care about this man very much and want to express it to him as much as I can, even though it‚Äôs not reciprocated. As an example, I tell him I value our friendship, our conversations or the help he has provided for us and most of the time the response is ‚ÄúOh, ok.‚Äù

Basically gave everything I owned to my ex (mattress, dressers, kitchen supplies, etc, etc). The stuff I do own is... very strange to say the least (4 large jars of clay I collected to make pigments, a large box of surfactants, to give you an idea). I have a single coffee cup, a fork, and a bowl for dishware.

I moved literally across the country -- put everything I own in my small car. I don't know anyone here (near Seattle) -- nor would I want to be a bother. Everything was so overwhelming when I moved in that I puked. 

I'd love some help making a list of the bits and bobs that are necessary for a functioning household -- I'm sure I'll pick up more as needed. I love to cook, so the kitchen won't be a problem. I've been trying to make running lists for different areas, but I feel stuck on what to tackle.

How should I design or furnish a functional living space? Especially if I have a guest. I drew up some simple schematics for the dimensions of my space so I can try and see how things would fit.

I work remotely, but I'll need to start working again on Monday.

I'm having a low period this week, and honestly don't feel like doing anything at all, I just want to curl up in bed alone. Usually lasts a few days before I start perking up again.

Problem is, I have a second date scheduled for tonight. We rescheduled the first one (that we did eventually go on) because she had a headache, so I wouldn't feel too guilty about rescheduling.

I'm just conflicted about the whole thing. I like this girl, I do want to spend more time with her. But this is my first ""second date"" in a few years, and I don't really have butterflies like I have had in the past. I don't know if this is because I'm older and wiser, jaded and burnt out, or just depressed.

I want to put my best foot forward, but does that mean following through on plans, or being at 100% at a later time?

Not to mention my conflict about depression vs burnout. Like with depression, people tend to isolate, and that's a bad thing in that context. But with ASD burnout, isolating makes me feel better.

(suck it up princess/buttercup, get over it, join the club, shut it, everything will sort itself out, it gets better etc etc etc...) please keep it to yourself... serious responses only please.

I spend most of my day, stuck looking at all the past forks in the road of my life, wondering what would have happened if I turned left or right. I also feel trapped inside my head, wondering if there is something else I should/could be doing, but know that I am where I am supposed to be, and if I was doing anything else, or earning more money, I would be potentially more exhausted or stressed out than I am already, daily.

TLDR long story short, I work in Facilities, a simple cog in the machine, that keeps the big earners wheels running, I restock their stationary, push in their chairs, tidy up their meeting rooms, and no one knows I exist. Kind of similar to a stagehand during Hamilton, everyone cares about the actors and the stage, but forget about the crew. 

I have minimal helicopter monitoring, I do my tasks efficiently and well, to the best of my ability, and then spend the rest of the day, surrounded by auditors/lawyers making their million dollar deals, negotiations, while I just sit, wasting the hours, dealing with my own feelings of inadequacy, impostor syndrome and feeling like I don't belong, struggling to shove those feelings down/away by doom-scrolling Twitter, and Reddit until I have to do my tasks again. 

I feel blessed knowing that I will never be blamed if a room is uncleaned, as long as I have already cleaned it, and because we have cleaners/janitors that do that, it is impossible to maintain a sense of constant vigilance, so I hold that knowledge pretty close, and can always ask for confirmation if there is anything I don't understand, at any time.

I just feel like I have a mind, that should be doing something other than what I am doing, I feel like I am wasting my time, or it could be used to do something/anything else, but then I counter that by coming to the conclusion that there is nothing else I really can do. Instead of doom-scrolling I could probably run a side hustle, but I have no idea where to begin, NFT's, BitCoin, Dropshipping all that shit has passed me by, and I don't really understand it anyway.  

I was always told growing up, find something you love to do, and get paid to do it, but when I was diagnosed, my psych asked me to write down everything I enjoy, and basically told me that none of it can be monetised.

I feel like success has passed me by, and I don't know how to keep telling myself to be thankful that I have a job, that it is easy, (like monkey level) and to just be grateful for what I have. True I could be earning more money, but potentially I would be doing something I hate. 

My new psych has me on ACT therapy and wants me to practise drop anchor and ACE therapies but there are not a lot of meditations I have found.

I happen to know of it and have found that there is actually a wealth of treasure of wisdom and advice that is hidden underneath the story. It has been incredibly helpful for me and I thought I should share it with everyone here.

You will need to
1.) get familiar with how the chess pieces sounds when you are moving them around (physical chess board or on sites like chess.com). This is in terms of tempo.

2.) know a little bit about how the chess elo rating and title works. For example, there is a scene where the main character basically told the chess competition organizer that although she never competed in an official chess tournament, she wanted to join the competition where there will be chess ""Grand Masters"" and the event organizers tried to discourage her from doing so. However, Beth misunderstood this as them thinking she won't be able to compete because she is a girl, not because she is a beginner.

3.) be able to notice patterns hidden in the show. I don't think this is actually that difficult if you have aspergers. A lot of the scene where the main character has flashbacks seems to mimic how I tend to have flashbacks too, so it was easy to pick up.",werkph,10,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/werkph/has_anyone_watched_the_queens_gambit/

We haven't had much problems but we are away from each other for the summer as we met at University and I'm having a significantly harder time. I don't think i ever resonated with the aspie trait ""difficulty with change and schedule changes"" until now because I am have a very difficult time handling unexpected changes in plans and stuff. Like just now he said he was going to call me in 5 minutes and it's been 20 and I'm having a hard time just moving on to a next task. I'm experiencing a lot of high anxiety and depression that is some what related but also has a lot to do with being completely THC free for a month now ( super happy about this i don't ever want to go back to that stuff again, it's too easy to cope with). 

(Edit): I'd also like to add I'm struggling about his thoughts of me. In highschool i was crippled by other people's thoughts of me constantly obsessing over what people think of me and so sensitive to everything. It took a few years in an abusive relationship to have to build up my ego and self respect and learn to love myself and not care about what other people think. And while i feel quite successful in doing so: I don't really give a fuck what other people think anymore, I do EXCESSIVELY care what my boyfriend thinks of me and it's a bit unhealthy. I love him so much and i feel like this relationship is very healthy especially compared to my last one but at the same time I despise someone else having such total control of my mood and thoughts. It's like I'll be stuck on something about him and I'll be all depressed and effectively nullified until I get it resolved. Once it's resolved it's like I'm manic and my creative brain space comes back and I'm constantly having observations of life and my obsessions and enjoying my hobbies and even tasks i don't like. I don't know I'm just trying to map this stuff. Again it could have almost everything to do with coming off the THC but I would like to hear your experiences and thoughts on this.

I‚Äôm just now realizing how negatively my demeaner & personality impacts others and pushes them away. I used to be so annoying and completely unaware of why I was so alone. I honestly prefer the type of sadness that gave me. Now I‚Äôm hyperaware of everything I do that‚Äôs off. So many of my past friendships were based on them needing something from me and not genuinely wanting my presence at all. So many texts needing homework answers. Texts from me asking pathetically about the plans I hadn‚Äôt been invited to.

I‚Äôm struggling with my work. I suck so damn much at communicating that it‚Äôs clearly quite annoying to my colleagues. I come off as incredibly immature and incompetent.

Socially, I have no fucking clue what I‚Äôm gonna do to meet new people after I move. I‚Äôm better at managing my annoying tendancies, but also painfully aware that managing them entails avoiding any social events that involve partying, alcohol, etc. I‚Äôm enterring my 20s and moving to NYC but have no desire to club at all. I firebomb literally all social events.

Also approximate yearly earnings(vague is fine like 80-100K etc.) if you feel comfortable with sharing it and how easy it was to get into.

Often times, my parents would say that we were going to do something and I would get upset and start crying. They would say things like ""I know you don't like (loud noises, large crowds, and what have you) but we think it will be good for you"". So we would go, and I would be screaming and crying the entire time, and we often would leave early because I was clearly miserable. And when we got home, my parents would say that they knew I wouldn't like whatever it was and that going there/doing it was a bad idea.

When I was in preschool, we were going to have an open house. The teacher explained that we would be coming back to school in the evening with our parents and show them the classroom, our various projects, etc. I immediately got upset and started crying. I hated school and the thought of going back there at NIGHT didn't sit well with me at all. When my mom came to pick me up at the end of the day, I told her about what the teacher said, and my mom said that she already knew about it and we were going to go! Cue more screaming and crying. My mom said ""I know you don't want to go, but we're going to go anyway."" So we went. I remember my dad had to carry me because I was too upset to walk. I gripped him tightly and cried into his shoulder the entire time. Now this was a school for kids with special needs; there were maybe 10 kids in the class including me and basically was a class for kids who weren't able to tolerate the chaotic environment of a normal preschool, but if I remember correctly the other kids were eagerly showing their parents around, but I just cried. We stayed for maybe five minutes and then we went home. Later, my mom said that she knew that I would get upset and that it was a bad idea to go, but Dr. Asshole said that I had to do it or else I wouldn't be able to get by in the world.

786,who is transable?,['transable'],"My son told me I'm transable for saying I'm autistic. Until now, this word I had never heard of. Apparently a lot of ppl now are acting like they have different syndromes when they are perfectly normal. Why? I think it's for attention. I've heard of a lot of people on tictoc using this behavior. Maybe having one syndrome or another makes an individual feel 'special' in some way.

It makes you wonder. For me personally, I'm very borderline autistic, perfectly functioning in society. Perhaps its an abuse to call myself an Aspie. Especially since I've learned how to deal with some of my social issues, I get along perfectly fine. Nobody would be able to tell I'm a little off until really getting to know me. Does that make me just very good at masking? I've learned to generally keep my mouth shut which helps me get along in this world about as good as anybody.

My son sees his father as a functioning member of society, so from his perspective there's nothing wrong with me. But he honestly doesn't know what autism is, like most everybody around.

Speaking of which, many of the posts here, I end up thinking what does this has to do with being autistic? Half the people, when you ask them about their special interest, they say they don't have one. Over-diagnosis is a problem in itself. But I wonder about how many ppl identify as aspie, but are just looking for a reason why they struggle socially? There's more than one reason for why this could be happening.

I'm reminded of a poll here in this sub where people said whether they are trans-sexual, or cis, straight, or gay; the trans/gay portion there was *way* higher than the average in the population. Its possible there's some sort of correlation between these and autism, *possible*. But this also fits with the theory a lot people in the autistic 'community' are tans-able, trying to deal with other issues in their life. Or even just flat out attention seeking. 

What do you think?


Adding this preemptively:
This is not me gatekeeping, btw. I already know half the people on here will accuse me of such.

We were long distance (80 miles) for over two years but made it work through a pandemic and everything and had a good relationship until a few months ago when we discovered his dad had developed cancer. I want to say here that he lives with his folks) We hadn't seen each other for almost two months which caused a lot of friction for us and with the uncertainty of his dad's prognosis (upto a year of being separated due to cancer treatments) I initiated a breakup. I regretted it but I didn't know how we could be together but not do anything that a relationship needs. We talked it out and we agreed to end things. I found it really difficult and bombarded him with texts afterward and he ended up blocking me everywhere. I think the fact I mentioned things about him struggling to meet some of my emotional needs upset him more than I realised.

Every effort since to talk to him has been met with mostly silence. We emailed recently and told me some revisionist history that he actually told me that the reason he didn't want me to hang on was because we weren't going to get back together, but that didn't happen. I asked him if he could tell me what I did wrong to prevent us getting back together and he told me I didn't do anything wrong. But this doesn't help me.

He won't try to even speak to me and it hurts. I know for aspies that once they make a decision it's hard to not go back on it. What can I possibly do to try and at least get us talking again?

At 32 after getting every one of my siblings diagnosed with ASD and ADHD after seeing it in them, I realised I had it to. I pursued a diagnosis, and it ruined my life. Since I was diagnosed with ASD and ADHD I‚Äôve been unable to hold down a job, I‚Äôve isolated myself. My husband doesn‚Äôt even recognise me anymore. I‚Äôve been employed since I was 14, I came from a very poor family, bought my own house at age 20 while at university and working full time. I‚Äôm obsessed with helping people, I never think about my needs, I don‚Äôt stop helping people even when it‚Äôs unpaid. While at uni I had a successful career in business and banking and then decided I wanted to make more of an imprint on the world and took a huge pay cut and started working as a social worker. Everything was fine (though I was still a workaholic etc), I worked in child protection, then with refugees. I‚Äôve always been so respected and appreciated in the workplace because of the outcomes I produced no matter what I did, but then I got myself diagnosed simply because I knew I had it and wanted an explanation for why I operated so differently to others. That part was great. But since diagnosis I‚Äôve been sacked from one job for ‚Äòblurring ethical boundaries‚Äô and then landed a dream job straight after and didn‚Äôt pass probation because I was consistently late, even though I worked well over the hours I was paid. Before diagnosis I held myself to a higher standard. Everyone else got to work on time so I pushed myself to get there near on time or on time. It was exhausting, but I did it. I feel so ashamed that I just lost the only social work position I‚Äôve ever seen in Australia to pay over 100k.

So I am currently thinking about just not doing university anymore and instead spending my time doing the things I enjoy, doing volunteer work instead or writing a book etc...

This isn‚Äôt for school. I am acting like a manager and mentor for this project. Everyone has been volunteering including myself. I assigned tasks based on availability and match of skills. I set a regular flow of meetings to keep everyone aligned.

The problem I have is, one of my autistic peers seems to be off track sometimes. It wasn‚Äôt a big deal up until I noticed they would spend hours of their limited time on tasks that were low priority. 

I think hyperfocus could‚Äôve made them spend too much time in one task?  I did make it clear that the task is supposed to be low priority and low effort. 

Other tasks require more effort and time but very little work was finished. I asked this person if they are able to switch tasks and they happily agreed. 

 I‚Äôve seen them asking questions to our team on discord if there were other things he could do. When I looked at his to-do list, he hadn‚Äôt finished anything yet to then decide to start another project. 

I get that he might be looking for more stimulating things to do but we have deadlines to consider. He can only manage 1-2 hours a week. It would be extremely hard for me to provide feedback on multiple projects at once. 

I‚Äôm also hitting my limits with verbal communication by voice call. I‚Äôm starting to encourage my team to negotiate specific times to discuss feedback more thoroughly. Text based comments don‚Äôt work for others so I kinda have to adapt to help my team finish their tasks.

Sometimes when I look at the work being done by my autistic teammate, he‚Äôs very through and detailed. It‚Äôs great except when I provide feedback. It seems like he disregards it. I‚Äôm okay with recommendations it‚Äôs just the recommendations doesn‚Äôt fit the situation very well.

There is a science to it as well because it is an NMDA receptor antagonist.

ASD research strongly suggest it is an issue with the NMDA, and AMPA receptors, and the role of glutamate on the brain. Ketamine is a non-competitive channel blocker of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, which is probably why it worked for me. Yes I know it is illegal to use, and to be honest by the time I had dissolved it in ethanol and filtered to remove the mono-sodium-glutamate the street stuff is cut with, bloody expensive! 

Anyway they are bloody drug testing me now to make sure I am not using, and telling me I have to rely on therapeutics methods not medicines. ASD is a neurological disorder though.

Since stopping the bad stimming is back, the OCD, noise really really hurts again, to the point it makes me want to cry, bite myself or hit myself, or hair pull! Things I used to manage are now very very stressful. I feel very bitter about it!

I am skilled in my field, but I have had a hard time getting along with my colleagues. Over the past first year of working at this company I have been ostracized. That isn't dramatic, I have overheard my supervisors talk about me and say I am ""off"" and ""they need to keep an eye on me"". Any ideas what they meant by that? I have also been told by a 3rd party to be careful around my supervisors because they gossip to people about me. I am not sure exactly what I have done, so I could see how it would be hard to give me any specific advice. I accept that I probably will not become friends with any of my coworkers but I really want to do my best to show them that I am not so bad just autistic. It hurts to kind of give up and come to this conclusion- but it's clear I have no social capital with anyone to have recourse. I am trying to focus on my own work and keep to myself other than exchange small talk pleasantries. I can't help but have this gnawing anxious feeling that I am only becoming more and more hated. I do blame my problems on my being autistic, I wish I could get therapy or some type of help because I really want to have good relationships with those around me. I would like to try to make this workplace a better environment for myself. 

So far I am trying to follow these workplace ""rules"" for myself to hopefully help me get along better with coworkers. These rules I have developed based off of my own successes and failures. I am a POC and a queer woman so that will effect how I navigate the world. 


1. Avoid talking about myself. Do not be open about being queer at work. (I work at a school in a red state) 
2. Do not give advise, or feedback even when asked. If you do, make sure it is ""sandwiched"" between compliments. 
3. Do not bring up current events. 
4. Do not curse.
5. In general, don't hang out, do your work and then find ways to get out of the office if you have downtime (this is to avoid screwing up socially-- can't piss people off if you're not there.. at least I hope) 
6. Don't ask coworkers personal questions when they talk about their life. Just see what they tell you and listen. Don't comment an opinion or story. Just smile and nod and say affirming statements or summarize what they said in response. 
7.  Don't bring smelly food to office. 
8. Hair fixed, a nice but subtle perfume, simple earrings, matching outfit without loud patterns, and a moisturized face at minimum everyday for work.
9. Don't speak too loud, and try to keep emotions muted. 
10. Don't argue with the supervisors plan (even if you believe another strategy would be more effective).

808,Feeling like being in a situation with no escape. tldr - friend with a Borderline PD (with narcisstic traits and possible ADHD),"['adhd', 'narcisstic', 'escape', 'pd', 'borderline']"," 

Greetings all. Already posted this in the other subreddit, and this is a copy-pasta. I'm not sure how many of you have met borderlines or if this is the appropriate subreddit but, oh well - I'm a dude with Aspergers-ADHD that happens to be having a friendship with a guy that has Borderline PD with narcisstic traits (possibly ADHD as well) since November 2019. My older brother and him were good friends since like 2011 until 2019, when his abandoment issues (30 phone calls in an hour at times), substance abuse and impulsivity issues crossed the line.

He's constantly hypervigilant and distrusting of others' intentions and words. Very frenzy, hyperactive, impulsive, blunt, argumentative and direct to many people, but also facades lies inside at times to appear superior and cover up some honest thoughts. Monstruosly bad emotional regulation, grew up in a home with loads of conflict and arguing. In recent years he has became aware of having low self-love and self-esteem and eventually after he realizes his mishaps he genuinely becomes a very honest guy and admits it all. I can see that i'm slowly becoming his ''favourite person'' because i'm the only guy around he can easily open up to regarding certain topics and issues. The main issue for me is that he sometimes sees my unusual aspie traits and views them as weird and cockoo-like. And they can be, of course. But during confrontations he always requires instant explanations from people or it's simply manipulation or lying. Sometimes he can get very blunt to people and focus on their negative aspects, for the sake of ''telling it like it is'' and ''helping them in an unpleasant-but-must-face-it-way'' but i have a feeling that this is directly related to narcissism instead. It would personally take me about 5 hours to explain what ASD is to someone that has no clue about it and those situations always seem like some sort of a no-way-out scenario. And every time, after weeks and weeks of trying to talk in a rational manner, i start speaking in a bit more agressive or self-esteemish manner he gets defensive and says that it's my ''ego'' talking and just starts gaslightning. I really liked finally finding a friend who was direct and blunt, but for the last half a year i just became aware that every time i hang out with him, it rarely has anything to do with honesty and more with something manipulative. I always wanna talk in a calm fashion and tend to avoid conflict because i had personal issues with being conflicting and blunt-direct from age of 11 to 16 and with lack of social skills caused by ASD. I grew up in a very disagreaable, no-nonsense, hypervigilant and an invalidating region with a brutal war past. I developed a lot of guilt and insecurity over being righteous and moral in many situations because i always sensed that my executive functioning and brain overall just isn't working properly because i didn't achieve certain unrealistic personal expectations in regards to education, morals, didn't speak my mind as i want to, had trouble with task switching, overthinking etc. Which is why i calmed down around 17, stopped being irritable, calmed my behaviour to try and rationalize it. Sacrificed a potential career because of it apparently because everyone refers to me as a wasted potential. And the end result conclusion by others tends to be that i don't care about others or anything. Nowadays i suffer from not being able to be honest and blunt like i was before because i fear that every sort of conflict will lead into a disaster, a mental breakdown and that honesty doesn't neccessarily have to do anything with truth. Possible Avoidant PD. It's even harder when ASD and ADHD are the root cause of most of your life problems and can't explain it to 90 percent of people even if it was a PowerPoint presentation. I really wanna stop compulsively lying and be honest but i can't because it would likely give me a stroke. And to be honest, i am a bit jelaous of my friend always having that ability, even though it ruined his life most of time as well. But it also made him more authentic, many people started symphatizing it and it helped him stand up for himself, which i can't do for the sake of my life anymore. Though he really does get emphatic about me at times, apologizes for harsh treatment because he acknowledges that i grew up with some nasty shit but it's just affective empathy and not cognitive one. He only emphatizies for me having a bad childhood like he did, but in reality, he doesn't care at all about learning anything regarding mental health, or likely has a hard time believing about it because in 2019, after 8 years of his various drugs and alcohol addictions he quit it all and joined a certain religious cult. Spent a year or so altogether on a certain farm to get new directions in life. It has definitely made him a better person overall, but it also paved the way for some other more ''indirect'' BPD-NPD traits. For example, the belief of being the Super Soul and being competitive about it, having black-white thoughts over materialistic-spiritual nature, being very controlling over minor things to other people such as their music taste, amount of hair, who your friend is etc., and developing conservative and mysognystic worldviews, which i never expected from him because he was fairly liberal thorugh out his entire life. The very high drug and instant gratification avaliability that made him and makes him suffer hard likely paved way to his conservative worldviews. He is also pretty unsure about it at often times and started smoking cigarettes again a year ago. I'm personally mostly religious too, but i tend not to follow it blindly and have mostly liberal worldviews. Also his belief in reincarnation seems to make him supress his traumatic experiences and categorize them as a part of some other past life trauma so he doesn't have to deal with it. Often when he sees other people being mad he just laughs and says ''ha, trauma!'' because he asserts it's from various lives. And of course, he has no belief what so ever about having a PD at all, doesn't believe in modern psychology, they are all materialistic, karma eventually sorts those things out etc. and says that everyone has some disorder one way or another, that everyone's family is messy and he didn't even bother considering anything psychology related even during his copious drug use because his late dad (who also had BPD, but diagnosed with depression only) had bad experiences with SSRIs (that part is somewhat understandable although SSRIs personally helped). His cousin and his uncle from dad's side also have BPD, but the quiet sub-type. I suggested him BPD in a conversation once but he snubbed it like it was nothing. He realizes a lots of characteristics about it like self-hate, self-love, narcissism, supressing it inside etc., but doesn't acknowledge that he has abandonment issues even though he doesn't want me to have any other friends and once labeled himself to my mom as a saviour of his solitude or what not. He is also very attention-seeking in public and constantly seems to seek validation. His black-and-white worldviews are very detrimental to his mental health at times. We are both from the same town and grew up in an enviroment loaded with low awareness of mental health and stigmatization. It's still mostly the ''you're either normal or not normal'' type of thinking. It's likely the reason he never seeked any diagnosis. Luckily i grew up with a mom that graduated pedagogy and noticed instantly something about me was off...eventually got diagnosed at 12, even though i was in denial for 8 years just because of the built in subconscious influence of ''needing to be the normal guy'' by the enviroment. If it wasn't for my mom i would likely have developed BPD as well.

All in all, i feel like im stuck in a friendship i don't want to be, in a friendship that is causing me serious mental harm after years of self improving, but i feel very sorry for the guy in general because he's overall not bad at all and has been through a lot and don't want to cause him further pain by abandoning him, but my pity for others seems to be the major problem actually. I wanna be more selfish but i fucking can't. All i try is to not have contact with him and for several days it works, because he works as a firefighter 5 days a week, and slowly during that time my mental health starts to improve, but as soon as he's bored and has free time he calls me and i instantly feel nervous and triggered. Anyone have any clue what to do at this point?

I hope I dont offend any of you! In that case, I'm very sorry. I'm uneducated on this topic, but want to learn and understand as much as possible.

1. I've read that people with aspergers tend to struggle with physical intimacy (hugs, kisses, sex, everything in between), but does this mean that they simply dislike it/do not feel the need (even if they love someone)? Or can they enjoy it, but just struggle to know ""when the time is right""? And does this differ from person to person?

2. In your experience, to which degree does general aspergers symptoms differ from person to person? 

3. I'm a very emotional person who enjoys talking about psychology and feelings in general. Can this be a boring and uninteresting topic to someone with aspergers?

824,Are my (Aspie) expectations of my partner (Aspie) unreasonable?,"['aspie', 'unreasonable', 'partner', 'expectations']","Hi guys, girls and theys, I am married to someone on the spectrum and am on the spectrum myself. Our marriage is having troubles. We are both really trying but I have psychology and emotional intimacy as special interests and he is struggling in this area. He's also a product of childhood emotional neglect and we don't know which struggles are related to the neglect and which are from the autism. The ones from neglect are more malleable, so it actually does matter.

He attends personal therapy at my request and we are in couples therapy too. But I'm having a hard time with him not prioritizing his side of the situation by taking responsibility to initiate his own personal work. He won't even make a habit to read for five minutes a day on the subjects that he needs to improve up on for our relationship to be manageable for me (emotional intelligence, what he does that causes arguments to escalate, etc).

I struggle with believing he wants to have a healthy relationship as much as I do because he isn't putting it into daily action. I complain that he does not apply what he learns in therapy and he says he has ADHD. I say exactly! That's why I have asked for daily exposure to this information. If you don't keep it front of mind you'll forget it's a thing and continue the path of least resistance which is unnecessarily damaging to the relationship, and often puts the blame on me for things because you lack insight into how you are contributing to the problem.

He's got a genius IQ and has enough time to do this but chooses to play games instead. He just says he's not like me, because I do take time to read on self improvement. I don't expect him to be like me about it but I do expect him to put forth an equitable amount of effort. He's just reactive about everything, going along with me. I need him to be responsible for his own growth and.if he is just reactive about things then how is that taking responsibility?

He does have executive functioning issues like I do but I feel that if he really valued my feelings and needs he could find a way to take five minutes a day to work on his emotional intelligence. It feels like he doesn't really believe he's contributing to the issues if he won't learn independently. It results in me having to hold him accountable for all the homework we get from our marriage counselor, on top of holding myself accountable. She assigned a book for us to read a little each day and he's not brought it up once. I'm always the one having to initiate, remind him of the rules of fair fighting, etc and it's exhausting. I don't think it's fair either. But I don't know how much of this he can't help and how much is just that he doesn't want to take responsibility for facing his flaws every day.

So basically I really struggle with making friends and I struggle even worse with romance. Like I‚Äôm pretty confident in my looks. I notice women staring at me all the time. But I can‚Äôt bring myself to do anything ab it like I literally don‚Äôt know what to do. I honestly think it is a double edged sword bc some women think I‚Äôm a player or they are too intimidated to talk to me. And god knows I can‚Äôt properly cultivate a conversation. Sometimes women like me, and I do nothing ab it bc I‚Äôm either oblivious or idk what to do, and then said women gets upset with me ab it.

Every time I like someone it turns into this crippling obsession and it becomes even harder to talk to them (bc I‚Äôm scared of how I‚Äôm gonna fuck it up) and if I do I tell them my entire life story. I have a hard time going with the flow. I‚Äôve tried dating apps, talking to people at bars, parks, concerts etc but the convos normally die out pretty fast. I‚Äôm almost at the point where I feel like just being alone is better but I would be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt sometimes fantasize ab being in a relationship. 

I have no romantic experience and as I get older that‚Äôs started to discourage me (I‚Äôm 26 almost 27). I‚Äôm actually kinda scared to begin to like someone at this point bc I know I‚Äôm going to be obsessed very early and I‚Äôm terrified of being misunderstood and hurt again. Last time I was jobless for a year and a half and went completely broke, I lost all my friends, due to their insensitivity and my lack of communication skills. And that wasn‚Äôt even a relationship.

Even after years of divorce, my ex is still goes out of her way to cause me harm. She‚Äôs also legally trying to push me out of my son‚Äôs life. She‚Äôs knows I can‚Äôt afford an attorney and is using that to her advantage. Yes, she definitely needs therapy. 

In my job, I‚Äôve gotten better at setting boundaries but I still slip now and then. But I‚Äôm improving. 

I‚Äôm limiting contact with toxic people as much as possible. Talking small steps to stand up for myself but I‚Äôm scared. I know some people will react aggressively toward me.

-Getting some alone time: in a room, in the bathroom if there is no more options, going outside for a couple of minutes, etc.

I‚Äôll give a lengthy example: 

 I‚Äôm quite fond of this one girl I know (I‚Äôm a 17m)  and we‚Äôre both pretty shy and haven‚Äôt gotten to know each other. We met up on Saturday and I believe the heat was getting to us so she decided to go home earlier than I think we thought. She said she was getting tired and mentioned she had a headache and  she sounded like so aswell.  We usually would text everyday for a bit  but that started stopping the next day on Sunday. I‚Äôm planning to text her on Thursday since that‚Äôs our birthday (we were born in the same day) because it‚Äôs a topic that would make sense and I don‚Äôt like to bring up conversations with very little reason especially because we don‚Äôt know each other that well.  It then started hitting me just today that it could‚Äôve been something I did. I started thinking that I was being too awkward or  i said something I didn‚Äôt even remember. It‚Äôs pretty hard for me to cry (not because I don‚Äôt want to) but I was bawling with paranoia and was/is desperately waiting for Thursday to come not only to wish her happy birthday but so I can finally confirm what‚Äôs really going on. this usually happens  with every  friend I meet although it can be less severe than other times. It is pretty easy to think of how things will go wrong instead of right but it all just feels so  scary to think about when it‚Äôll strike next or worse if I really did something wrong.

However, these voices were not specialists in neurodiversity. Since seeking out and working with a psychologist who is a specialist in neurodiversity, I have been formally diagnosed with ADHD and ASD (aged 25). He (the psychologist) told me that my masking skills and academic intelligence are the reason I don‚Äôt present obviously as ND, and that I fit a fairly common and logical pattern for ‚Äôhigh performing‚Äô ND individuals. This combined with my survival skills to cope with a highly turbulent home environment, whereby I learnt to internalise all my struggles and find safety in perfectionism and helping others.

I‚Äôm looking for tips on supporting my partner with ASD while not dismissing my own needs.

My partner is incredibly smart, funny and generous, with a heart of gold. However, he has anger outbursts that are like an On/Off switch and is unable to control his emotions. It has cost him most of his relationships and meant he hasn‚Äôt ever had close friends. 

I‚Äôm a naturally patient person and grown up with neurodivergent siblings so have empathy and understanding. However, I‚Äôm starting to feel exhausted by bearing the brunt of his moods. I also have ADHD and can‚Äôt take the medication due to how it exacerbates my other health issues. This means I‚Äôm often absentminded, forgetful, clumsy or in my own world. This is at odds with his very regimented, perfectionist viewpoint (all wonderful character traits that I love!), so I get on his nerves often and he is very vocal about his annoyance. He‚Äôll lose his patience/temper or say something quite cutting several times a day. Then once the moment is done, it‚Äôs like nothing happened for him. Meanwhile, I have to deal with how it makes me feel and can‚Äôt move on from how upset it makes me, no matter how hard I try (and having intense Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria doesn‚Äôt help). I am trying so hard to anticipate his needs and be less clumsy, but sometimes, just like he can‚Äôt help his outbursts, I can‚Äôt help my scatty nature.

I have talked to him about this and he has apologised and is making efforts to be better. He recognised how much I do for him and how hard I try. He is on an unfortunately months long waiting list for CBT and talk therapy. He is aware of how damaging his outbursts are and how they make me feel. But with him quitting smoking, they‚Äôre even worse right now. He doesn‚Äôt even realise that they happen.

We‚Äôve been together for years and see each other as life partners. He has supported me through some incredibly difficult times. I want to do the same for him but right now I feel so overwhelmed by how low I feel about it that makes me feel like walking away.

849,What do I do?,[],"I'm about to go into my senior year of high school. I have a lot of trauma associated with the feeling of being ""othered"" and for the most part, high school only exacerbated that. I had a really hard time struggling with validation, insecurity, earnesty and attachment, and for the most part it felt like I was treading on light water trying to mask my autism, maintain my friendships and putting twice as much effort into everything that comes naturally for neurotypical people. There were good moments though in the midst of it. Eventually I started spiralling downwards ( partly because of the pandemic, partly prematurely switching schools) and in the past two years, I've had two suicide attempts, three psychotic breaks, have been hospitalized twice and have had my peers slowly regarding me with contempt. It's disillusioning to discover \[friendship, love, connection, family\] is circumstantial to perception. Forward to this summer and after a couple of hospital visits, breakdowns, and a turning point \[ER visit\], I was given a tentative Asperger's diagnosis. I'm starting to decondition myself of all the painful experiences and I can feel myself getting better, having more clarity and peace of mind, but I don't like my home life.

My mother has had a very hard life. She's been through many traumatic events, which aren't my stories to tell. She's always been hypervigilant after my dad passed. My brother is ten years older than me and has served as a father figure to me ever since, yet I find myself frustrated with him recently. I wish my family life were different. I care about my family. My mother's memory and cognition is visibly worsening and she mentions her company laying people off, and my brother talks to us in demeaning tones and didactic arrogances guised under light-heartedness. I pick up on his behaviour unconsciously, and it comes up in the way I talk to my friends and family. The man he is right now, does not represent the man I want to become. We stockpile on food every two weeks and sometimes when we open the fridge there's mold on the vegetables. We have a clutter problem that's improving. The family dynamic is complex and trauma is in the blind spots. I have an attention problem and dependences to escape. I have big dreams but I feel as if a mandatory compromise is on the horizon if I don't figure a way out. I want to improve my family's health, establish a collective spirit, improve my health, and pursue my dreams, and make my due money without compromising but I feel as if I wasn't given a chance before I realized I needed to fight, or realized there was something wrong in the first place. I think the most important thing that ties all of this together is drive, but it's hard when there's too much to let go of.

852,"Nocturnal, ADHD, and ASD","['adhd', 'nocturnal', 'asd']","The following is another message from someone who has Aspergers, ADHD, and has had trouble sleeping to those who are looking to help their family members with those specific issues. None of what I say is based off any one specific part of research other than my own. If you/your family member experience things differently, please don't be afraid to speak up in the comments. I'm here to help, and with your comments, we can help more people.

. . .

On my mission to understand exactly why my brain works the way it does, I started to do research on why I'm more nocturnal than other people and have come to the following conclusion.

ADHD is a mental disorder, which means that its more or less the hyperactivity and stimulation of your mind where you are thinking of a million things at once nearly all the time.

Now, add in the hypersensitivity that comes with autism when looking at me.

The reason I am nocturnal is because of the relative quietness of night. There isn't the bustling of traffic and other humans outside providing overstimulation. At night, a person is more able to focus on themselves than they are during the day.

Its why I never could stick to a designated schedule during the day. Or, rather, I would always have challenges sticking to one. The overstimulation is tiring of the mind.

At night, when you're laying in bed with the lights off and can't see, you are left with your mind to occupy you. The racing thoughts and anxieties and stresses that come with them keep you awake. Its a gift and a curse.

Its a gift because you're able to take the time you need knowing you won't be distracted by the outside world to refocus your mind and better prepare yourself for the next day.

Its a curse because by the time you've sorted through your thoughts and overcome your fears and anxieties, the next day is here and you're expected to be awake and to conform to the world's expectations of working the day and sleeping the night away.

If you're struggling with your sleep, it might not be that you're messed up, it might be the schedule you're on. Change your schedule to optimize yourself so you can take on the day/night with a clear and focused mind. Its gonna take some time to find that little nich√© where you know is your best times, but when you do, you're more than prepared to tackle the life you set forward for yourself.

Don't be afraid of the expectations of other people unless you have promised to meet those expectations. Don't promise to meet their expectations when you know exactly how to best optimize your day.

Be on your schedule and use your self-knowledge to best live your life. Don't let society tell you how you should live your life when its YOUR life not theirs!",wdeo3l,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wdeo3l/nocturnal_adhd_and_asd/

There is no cure for Asperger's, but there are ways to manage the symptoms and make life easier. One of the biggest challenges people with Asperger's face is societal pressure.

From an early age, we are taught that we have to conform to certain standards in order to be accepted by society. We are told that we have to act a certain way, look a certain way, and think a certain way. This can be incredibly overwhelming for someone with Asperger's, who may already struggle with social interaction and communication.

The good news is that there are ways to deal with societal pressure, even if you have Asperger's. Here are some tips:

-Learn as much as you can about Asperger's syndrome. The more you know about your condition, the better equipped you will be to deal with it.
-Find other people who have Asperger's syndrome. It can be helpful to connect with others who understand what you're going through.
-Educate yourself on social norms and expectations. Knowing what is considered ""normal"" behavior can help you avoid feeling overwhelmed by societal pressure.

863,"Help when feeling anguish over what autism prevents me, and perhaps huge number of my atpyical peers, form being able to do even with my educational background","['autism', 'anguish', 'educational', 'feeling', 'able']"," 

So my background has been brought up before. Basically, I also have autism and ADHD, conceivably am at level 2 in some ways in terms of support needs, though I've struggled to get an accurate diagnoses. And didn't realize this in any way until late 20s. And have tried to prepare myself for future living as much as possible by going the route countless others did: being as well educated as possible up to and including obtaining a PhD, in my case in physics. And in my case, that still hasn't led to any significant periods of my life where I could become truly financially independent or be able to to find and work the types of jobs that allow for this for long enough to be able to achieve this. And in my case, I suspect spectrum issues have a lot to do with this.

To reiterate as to what I am in now, current work in a research related position that requires searching on internet for various new material, coding, instructions, science lectures and so on. And while doing this, every now again stories of success of entrepreneurs, stars as young as their teens, yt and ig stars, often who don't have any education past high school, shows up. Examples, such as [1](https://www.youtube.com/c/xQcOW) [2](https://www.youtube.com/c/BotezLive) [3](https://www.youtube.com/c/SSSniperWolf) [4](https://www.youtube.com/user/MrBeast6000) [5](https://www.youtube.com/c/HasanAbi) show up and the messages I get are destructive. One is that the concept of getting educated in topics such as science, design, programming, research, math, writing and other work was an especially cruel prank I and numerous others fell for. Since the route the self made and self supported stars of these channels took was the right way all along, seeing as how all of them are financially secure in a way I haven't been able to be and possibly never will and education in any traditional way wasn't part of it. Or that in order to make a case for the need for science and intellectualism in society, I need to find something that brings massive success but for various reasons don't know where to start.

Now I know that one step in addressing this is making serious steps to curtail social media use. It's a grotesque societal cancer that future, more advanced civilizations will look back on in ungodly sham. That said, intellectual and research based work requires digital media in some capacity so it can't ever be 100 % avoided.

Videos addressing this crisis, such as [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Afk0h0dPBhE) are quite helpful too. Beyond that, I was wondering as to what can help when it starts to really badly hurt my mental health. Is there a way of looking at this I haven't thought of? Is there an aspect to this sort of digital success and entertainment I didn't consider or possibly that the way I'm viewing this is distorted in ways I don't see?",wdi8zz,1,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wdi8zz/help_when_feeling_anguish_over_what_autism/

Current fears are,

1. Wasps, hornets, and yellow jackets. However, I think bees are neat.

2. Barbed wire and regular metal wire, like what would be used to hold hay bales together. Mostly because I think being caught in barbed wire would be scary, and for sensory reasons. I have a love/hate relationship with metals.

I'm starting in a different college with a whole new group of people who I don't know and I'm extremely nervous that I'll like self-isolate because of my social anxiety and obliviousness just like I did the first time. I really want to come across as an agreeable person and maybe make a few friends because the subject I'm studying has a lot of group work involved in it. The program will be very demanding and stressful and being uncomfortable in the presence of my classmates will add a lot of unnecessary stress to my life.
During the orientation I saw that my class was like 90% female. I hate to sound like ""oh I'm not like the other girls"" because I get that that's annoying but I have never been able to understand female friendships, the few ones I've had have been NDs.

889,Advice on preventing burnout?,"['burnout', 'advice', 'preventing']","FYI: I haven‚Äôt been officially diagnosed yet, however my psychologist and psychiatrist both think that I might have Asperger‚Äôs.

I‚Äôve been having burnouts at school constantly ever since I was a child. These burnouts would cause me constant panic attacks and I was afraid to leave my home even for a walk around the neighborhood. I came to a point last year when I couldn‚Äôt go to school anymore so I had to switch to a special program for the rest of the year but that made me very depressed, since everyone I know kept on living their lives and I completely drifted apart from my friends, not to mention the unbearable shame I felt for being different.

I‚Äôm so tired of this constant cycle. I always overwork myself, go out constantly and then burn out and lay in my bed for weeks/ months and not do anything. I can‚Äôt seem to find a healthy balance between the two.

890,Is too much masking a form of self-hatred?,"['hatred', 'masking', 'self', 'form']","I understand if you're at a family gathering with uncle Billy and aunt Karen who expect you to be their lovely nephew that they always have imagined and you don't want to screw up that image, so you hide your autistic traits for their time being there, however, if you mask too heavily when making new friends, at parties, among co-workers, for people who don't really matter that much, I really see it as a form of self-hatred. 

You're packing yourself up into this version of you that you believe is socially acceptable and spend enormous amounts of energy on keeping up this persona instead of just letting go and being yourself,  take it or leave it. Because you believe that who you really are is not good and that you may under no circumstances show them who you are, or the world can get cruel, I know. But there's really no reason to mask too much, as it's impossible to make meaningful friendships if you're masking too much. 

And I know for myself that as I've been masking so much for the past few years, it only served to make people uncomfortable, and all the aquintances went to waste as people would rather not have anything to do with me. It was not until I was at this hostel a few days ago, I would behave like a freak, but people thought it was funny, and it really provided that friction to make good friendships.",wczorp,4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wczorp/is_too_much_masking_a_form_of_selfhatred/

My son is 21years old, very intelligent with a broad interested base, he's funny and so laid back he's almost impossible to motivate. He also has dyspraxia which makes writing difficult as a result he avoids doing it if he can.
He's had one job where he collected trolleys at a supermarket but he lost that due to reluctance to follow shift  patterns. Since then he claims to have applied for various jobs but I don't know if he has or not. I've tried to engage him in conversation but just gives me a blank stare and one word answers.
He will not tell the employment services that he has ASD so they probably think he's not trying to get a job or that he's lazy.
He great with maths, computing facts and figures but because he struggles with interpersonal skills, office work would be a none starter unless they were very accommodating.
I really don't know what to do.
I really want him to become independent. Life can be hard enough without being considered different.
As for me I perfected the fake persona years ago but I think I've burnt out and it's becoming hard to pretend, it's no longer a reflex but a struggle to apply.",wcqnd9,11,22,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wcqnd9/employment_help_for_my_son/

Its almost always on a post about making friends, or dealing people being rude and this is a solution given. The person asking advice/venting doesn't ask about how to make eye contact or that they want to. They don't ask about masking either.

901,online spaces not welcoming anymore,"['welcoming', 'spaces', 'online', 'anymore']","I've always found comfort in online spaces ever since I got my hands on my first ever laptop as a teen, which sucked me into the world of the arts and fandom. It helped me expand my interests and develop amazing skills, from learning English to becoming an illustrator and finally developing people skills. Fandom has always been a huge source of joy and motivation for me. But in recent years I find myself doom scrolling and getting mild anxiety attacks from some of the toxicity I see online, as there is no way to escape it. This makes me very sad as I don't know how I can continue consuming and enjoying my hobbies in peace. I'm too scared to post certain art, opinions or feelings anymore as I've gotten dogpiled multiple times by different radical groups for not believing in ultra specific internet jargon that no sane person in real life is capable of understanding. I try to post privately as to not attract attention but inevitably people still find me. I'm also trans and have been targeted by terfs on multiple occasions for some reason ( it's like they witch hunt trans people for a living ) and received some very sexist and transphobic attacks, so I have to protect myself and shield myself from the feminist movement as a whole as I don't know who to trust anymore, even if I'm ideologically a feminist myself. I am not alone in this.  

 Im so obsessed over not being in the wrong, that I can spend days/weeks compulsively hyperfixating on topics in hopes of researching every single angle of it so I wouldn't offend anyone, no matter what side of the political spectrum they're on. This has lead me to have multiple identity crises. I consider myself a leftist but the political correctness is too much to keep up with. I frequently have meltdowns over not being able to please anyone no matter how hard I try. 
It all seemed so much easier and more innocent in the earlier says of the internet. I don't know if I was just better at avoiding trolls and toxic information than I am now, but I just can't keep this up. With the current age of informational warfare, war in my own country, social media (esp twitter) drama, politics and never ending discourse, I'm afraid that I've lost the comfort I used to be able to find online. I belong to too many sub-groups and am just not welcome in americentric spaces ( I'm Slavic ) which people don't realize actually constitute like 99% of the internet. Discourse happens strictly through the American lense and has caused me too many misunderstandings. Foreigners constantly have to adapt themselves to the ultra specific online experience that American media cultivated. The only reason I learned English is so that more information could be accessible to me, and yet I get shoo'd away from spaces for not being western enough to have a say in anything, when I'm simply trying to learn. 

Writing this alone may have already possibly ruffled some feathers, I'm afraid. If it has, I ask you, why? I don't wish to offend, so why are you? Can we not ask innocent questions without jumping to conclusions like normies do all the time? Can we not be more graceful with one another and admit that's it's okay to ask stupid questions sometimes, make mistakes, make assumptions, and then laugh about what we got wrong and learn something new? Instead of demonizing those we don't understand? Everyone is so divided nowadays it's almost like we're all on guard and have these instinctive knee-jerk reactions to things that rumours taught us we should be vary of. This is a dangerous mentality to have especially after seeing how many other autistic people get dogpiled for asking innocent questions.

This was the only place I could find confort and be myself, and now I'm considering leaving everything behind and keeping my thoughts to myself. This makes me sad since I know for a fact that there's plenty of people I can find camaraderie with and bond over the same struggles with, and that my voice resonates with them, and is even important due to my unique set of circumstances, but the backlash and hatred of certain people is just too strong. I do not have enough grace and impulsivity control to ignore it. I'm too oversensitive to criticism that even making anonymous accounts still has me worried i might offend, but I don't want to abandon my communities online just yet. 

Had anyone else felt similar anxiety over this? What have you done to manage stressors you might be exposed to online? Have you abandoned the internet altogether or restricted yourself to specific social media ? Is there anything I can do to block certain content? Are there any artists out there who also feel stuck between wanting to be part of the online art community, all while constantly trying to flee discourse? What can I do about this? I'm really at a loss.",wctkww,3,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wctkww/online_spaces_not_welcoming_anymore/

This is supposed to be an autistic trait right but is it an autistic thing to constantly change them? I will get so heavily into something and I would worry non stop if I feel I would be unable to persue that. I used to be obsessed with archery and then I got a shoulder injury. That was it for me I was telling my therapist about that jeez.

So yeah my whole world will revolve about something then all of a sudden at some point something else will grab me and I won't care about the previous thing any more.

They have been described as phases by my family ""oh he's just going through another one of his phases, he'll probably drop it at one point"" they'll say.

My house is full of random purchases from guitars, to kayaks to frickin didgeridoos, punchbag. Stuff I never use anymore. Got knows what the YouTube algorithm thinks of me.

I think this is why I can't succeed in life, because my focus just changes all the time. I change all the time. These obsessions seem to define who I am at the time. 

It has been of some benefit to me though, I find now that I am in my 30's I just know alot of stuff about alot of things. I feel I can add my two cents to alot of subjects if someone brings them up to me. I also find myself returning to old obsessions.

I knew from the start he was on the spectrum. He had a very hard time during lock down and did not recovered fully from it. We felt really connected because we both went through hard shit and I am adhd and depressed on medication since few years now. He also been medicated but never fully diagnosed, but always assume he was on the spectrum cause his dad and siblings are.

More we talk more I liked him. We start a very nice long distance relationship, I didn't want to get to close and neither him cause we both got badly hurt by previous relationship.
We took a nice slow pace, always communicating honestly about our feeling, I loved his genuine kindness I could really feel safe with him, I start to have feelings for him and he told me it was mutual.

We keep visiting each other like once a month and it was always wonderfull

One day after I visited him for a week, more than usual, he went silent for few days, I was worried but we never texted too much, he works a lot, I don't like too fusional relationship it really was OK for me to not text all the time.
But he never left me for like 5 days

He came back and explained that sometimes, because of lockdown, being with a person a bit long 24/24, could overwhelm him and he needed time to feel OK. I completely understood and I could tell he was genuine and honest


But end of June... I visited him, it was the same, wonderful (from my part).
At that time I could see his work was killing him emotionally and physically. He was tired and stress the last time I saw him but tried to keep and OK face.

I came home and everything went down. He became silent again but for 2 week had 1/2 text a week but nothing else
One day he told me he was struggling with his mental health and he needed to ""be quiet for a while"" I was sad but I understood it. I didn't text him or anything, but I sadly learn than both of my dad a'd grandad might have ca'cer and I felt a waves of emotion I couldn't hold.
I was also missing him tons.

I got drunk one day a'd texted him. Nothing mean nothing toxic just me saying I missed him badly and I was struggling a lot and he respond 2 days later saying he needed a break in our relationship

Autistic friends told me that could happen but I am very lost, I'm the contrary I need to share and I'm very emotional, I always asked him if it Was tiring him and as a not very emotional person he always swear that it was a part he enjoyed about me like we were balancing each other.

He doesn't talk to me anymore and I feel very very sad. My friend just tells me he's an ass etc. Part of me still hope. But if you could help me understanding him more, why he disappeared like this..is he having an shutdown or.. I am very lost and I'm not in contact with him anymore.

Sorry for the long post but I needed to explain everything... I love him and I feel like I lost him for ever. Breaks my heart.
Did I pushed him too much? Feels like I did everything wrong.. But I try to also keep in mind that everything is not about me..

917,Narrating Social/Psychological Dynamics?,"['narrating', 'psychological', 'social', 'dynamics']","I recently realized that I might have Asperger's  (18M ).  I knew I was always different and and I heavily relate to most traits. Although, I sometimes feel imposter syndrome because I'm extremely empathetic and have a very good (I hope) understanding of facial features and body language through what I'm sure is years of trial and error and screwing up social interactions (so much cringe when I reel through memories with new-found knowledge). My mind is a hurricane of like 10-layered thoughts and visuals and social interactions is me juggling just a disgusting amount of information. Naturally, I value my alone time.

Recently I've had both my best-friend and my sister (separately) tell me that I analyze and narrate subtext and their psyches all the time and it tires them because I'm correct (I'm not bragging, this is literally what was said) and that they know but they don't want to be reminded of their subconscious/conscious issues & traumas.  My friend said it feels like I'm twisting the knife that's already in him every time I bring up (narrate) what's happening in the interaction that's not being said.  And my sister generally said the same thing, different context and scenarios but the same issue on my part. They know me like no one else, especially my best friend. I know I've had these type of interactions with them for years. It's what made me research my Asperger's traits. 

I didn't really realize that I did this but it kind of woke me up and made me insecure. I looked back at interactions I have at work with my co-workers (friendly) and I'd see it in action. I had a full profile for this girl and would just tease her with these borderline factual-humorous statements regarding her character that didn't really beat around the bush. Then a couple weeks later of us being friends she opens up to me kind of callously and quickly that she was r\*p\*d a couple years ago which perfectly fit with what I suspected. 

CRINGE and trigger disclaimer: I literally would flat out call her traumatized or a r\*pist when she did or said something that fit perfectly with what I assumed was a ""victim-becomes-assaulter"" type of trauma simmering in her subconscious. I know that sounds extra but that was later proven true because she started very frequently not respecting my physical/sexual boundaries (nothing too bad but still, I won't go into detail but it's definitely there. )

 Lastly, a week ago (after I realized this narrating aspect of me) a different co-worker who I've known for a couple weeks made a joke, or said something fun I guess, specifically ""we have sibling energy."" (talks to me a lot so I was able to build up enough of a profile.) Which I impulsively responded with a sentence that identified her psychological biases and insecurities. 

As soon as I said what I said I realized that I narrated again and felt like shit. Thankfully, she didn't respond and she buried my reply so quick but kept her energy and dialogue going as if I said nothing but not in a malicious way but instead it was as if she was not letting herself feel anything for it.  I felt like an idiot and I went to the bathroom to relax and calm down because my mind was racing with insecure thoughts. 

Of course, I know I'm not some precise machine and these conclusions I make are liable to be false in some sense. However, I've had years of dealing with mentally ill family and friends so I have enough experience to trust my perception. I can't control this annotation of these social interactions, I don't always bring my conclusions to light but I almost always peaking under people's minds and I hate it because it's rooted in social anxiety and such because I clearly had to learn for a reason. 

I don't want to be this over the top literal and unable to hide what I'm thinking type of person. Everyone says I'm really honest and genuine and the more I scroll through my memories and see them with this new lens it just makes the division between me and normal even more clear. 

I know I'm not stupid but I regularly have conversations where my mind is going so fast that I seem like a bumbling idiot unable to decide whether or not I should prod this topic. I used to think everyone else was weird but idk anymore.

I lost track of where I was going with this post but it became a vent I guess and now I'm looking for comfort in people relating to me.",wcjfgh,4,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wcjfgh/narrating_socialpsychological_dynamics/

919,Does anybody feel like they actually might have ADHD as opposed to Asperger's?,"['adhd', 'asperger', 'does', 'anybody', 'actually']","Throughout my life I have had a very difficult time concentrating on stuff and staying focused. I am very easily distracted and my brain seems to focus on whatever the distraction might be. This happens most often if the thing I'm supposed to be focusing on is too difficult. Tasks/assignments that I understand and know how to do are easier for me to focus on. If not, I will either be distracted by, idk, a random object in the room, or else my mind will wander and I will be thinking of an idea I had or something that is stressing me out/making me anxious.

I also had a LOT of behavior problems in school and got in trouble very many times for disrupting the class. As a result of all these things, I was homeschooled from 2nd grade up through 8th grade, and went back to school when I was a high school freshman. As I got older my behavior in class improved and towards the end of high school, my teachers considered me to be a model student! However, unless it's something that's easy for me to understand or I find stimulating (which most of the time happens with tasks that I am good at or that really pique my interest), it's still hard for me to focus.

The therapy that I revived as a kid focused on developing my social skills, and I feel like my academic education was somewhat sacrificed. I felt like I learned the most academically when I was homeschooled. Even though I ended up enjoying my high school years, I really can't think of anything I learned academically.

I'm writing this post when I should really be focusing on a computer programming assignment from my dad. I'm learning Java and tried to take a class at my community college, but I had to drop out because it was too fast-paced, so I'm studying with my dad who has been a programmer for over 40 years and explains stuff in a way that's easy to understand. He also doesn't have a decree in programming and is mostly self-taught. He's managed to build a successful career out of something that he seemed to have a natural gift for, which I admire. I hope to one day get a job in programming and follow in my dad's footsteps, but some of the things are just too difficult to focus on. If it's something I already know how to do, I can use it to write a program with little help. But there's a lot of stuff I don't know how to do and when that happens I get stuck. And being stuck makes it difficult to focus, therefore I get distracted by stuff that my brain wants to focus on in the moment.

924,Aspergers.. Impostor syndrome?,"['aspergers', 'impostor', 'syndrome']","Hey guys, so recently I found out via my parents  I was diagnosed with Aspergers since childhood, and although it was not documented, the psychiatrist who gave me that diagnosis told my parents to keep an eye on me and spot syntoms I'd likely have in the future, that being lack of eye contact, speech patterns, etc. And even now it's become overwhelmingly clear I have some form of low functioning aspers. However, before and after the diagnosis, I have always been doing ""decent"" enough to never think of myself as mentally ill (until post pandemic, where me asking my parents about myself got them to spill the beans) and many problems I faced I thought of as normal for normal people like me instead of me suffering from aspergers, so now that I'm diagnosed as mentally ill, I find myself feeling confused and inauthentic, as if either 1. My existence until now has been a lie or 2. My existence, now is a lie. As someone who is interested in general morals and ethics, I don't think that I actually have aspergers sometimes and am just pretending to have it in order to fit a narrative (even though my parents would have no reason to lie to me)

For example, I like going outside with headphones, but I also read somewhere that going outside with headphones is an indicator of autism. Does thi smean I'm just behaving like a normal person in the spectrum? Does it not mean anything? Or what if I started subcounsciously pretending I like going outside with headphones to fit my Asperger's narrative? Am I supposed to have sensory overload? Have I had sensory overload this whole time? I didn't even know!!! etc.. etc.

How do I go about this? I've heard generally the road to accepting mental illness is to accept it as a part of you that is a core to your identity, but for me it's weird since I never even knew I was mentally ill to begin with until I started thinking I was behaving weird about a year or two ago.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

ADDED BONUS! There's obviously a heavy burden with carrying the Asperger's label on both sides of the argument, for example one side will shun you for being ""weird"" or dumb as some people expressed to me even before my diagnosis and the other side will think you're exactly like Elon Musk or some ultra intelligent being. I have no idea how to even come to terms with being labeled as Asperger's alone, and many people (like my parents) alraedy console me with saying thing such as ""Elon Musk has autism"", which I assume is in good faith but it makes me think; who am I (On the spectrum)? Am I supposed to be smart? To act smart? Is this something I should worry about?

But let's give the devil his due: it messed me up to learn that I was different from other people. This dance of gestures, facial expressions and tone of voice is so important to getting along with people on a daily basis. NTs take it for granted, and I huff and puff through a conversation with a stranger. They don't even know what I'm talking about. 

But there is more to life than that though, and I can do things other people can't do and they can do things I can't. That's what it means to contribute to society. That's what it means to me.

I want to preface this by saying that this is a compassionate act which takes effort from us in order to make NTs feel more comfortable. Please do not judge yourself over eye contact and please do not prioritize their comfort over your health. Also, I am a trans woman. I rarely make eye contact now unless I am confident in being gendered correctly. Some people open themselves up to repeated rejection through eye contact which is painful and isolating.

My newest one is practicing eye contact with my dog and making eye contact in video games. It has helped a bit.

Otherwise when I was feeling better I was good at glancing in their eyes once when I started talking and once when I ended. Occasionally looking while they speak. It‚Äôs not perfect but seemed to be enough for most people. When I do this well the social results are noticeable.

I am getting my ASD diagnosis on Monday. Waiting for an assessment for ADHD. I'm currently in what I think is Autistic burnout. When I get like this pretty much the only thing I can do is learn which does not help to recover at speed. But it does help me to focus on something other than my internal turmoil. And to separate my problems out from myself and view them with curiosity instead of fear. At first (and this still continues) I turned my attention to ASD and ADHD. Absorbing all that I can lay my hands on. Whilst looking at my DNA using online programs it flagged up a strong likelihood for EDS type 4. The vascular type. After a week of near constant research and retrospection, I have concluded that this is an accurate diagnosis for EDS. And the diagnosis for type 4 also seems to be correct. Although I am hopefully doubtful. 
Does anyone have any advice for what I can do for myself whilst I wait for the diagnostic battle to begin? Any advice for pain management and the symptom of hot flashes would be particularly useful.

948,I'm curious : your experience(s) with tobacco and alcohol or drugs in general?,"['tobacco', 'drugs', 'alcohol', 'experience', 'curious']","To start I have to say I'm not 100% sure I'm an Asperger because it is a late discovery for me and I've never tried being diagnosed. At 43 I'm not sure it's worth it. There are a lot of points that lead me to believe I am, but I'm not certain.

Anyways, back to the subject. I tried smoking cigarettes out of curiosity when I was 16 or so, and there was a time when I smoked a friend's cigarette each time we partied (from 18 to 22 years old approx. and we often had party nights at that time), but aside from that I never smoked. I never thought that the effect was so good that I had to smoke in my own time, and when those guys and me parted ways, I never smoked again. I think I never felt comfortable putting any substance in my lungs actually : since I was a kid I always frowned at my whole family smoking (I always hated that they smoked), and most of the time I had to be drunk myself to do it ü§£ Plus I didn't particularly like the effects it had on my brain and sight, same thing with drinking - I prefer to be 100% clear-headed.

At party nights I often want to have one or two drinks though because I like the initial effects of making me more talkative / outgoing / carefree... ...but I have difficulty to stop afterwards üòÇ (the social environment puts pressure that alcohol relieves, I guess... ...or it's just the easy / only thing to do)... ...so I often end up drinking too much and either don't remember what happens after a certain point, or I suddenly realize that I stopped thinking before letting words come out of my mouth. This second scenario makes me isolate myself because I have to try and recall everything I've said up to this point, to try and analyze what happened (so I can check if what I said was acceptable / if I didn't shoot myself in the knee socially-wise... üòë). This puts me in my own head and ruins the rest of the evening for me.

I almost never drink or party these days anyways. I don't really have friends anymore so I have no reason to, and as you can probably tell, drugs aren't my thing. They're considered bad for a reason after all. I'm curious if my experience is an Aspy thing or if I'm just weird!

952,My mind is becoming more and more empty and i can barely think,"['mind', 'think', 'barely']","Very empty mind, no spontanious thougt process, no emotions and bad memory

I have no inner life and i cant think

Before i had a room in my brain that my mind was in. It got more and more empty. But the physical feeling of a space or a room in my head was still there. I was just depressed and stressed, so i Did not manage to use this room so much. 

When i close my eyes now. That room is gone. I cant Feel it. It is like i have my eyes and behind my eyes there is nothing.

Before the room felt empty. Now it does not Feel empty. It just does not Feel like anything because there is nothing there anymore.

I have no spontanious thougts, ideas, no songs playing in my head, no images or memories popping up. I also cant seem to recall memories or knowledge. 

I have no emotions at all. My body feels dead and lifeless. I also used to be in my body and Feel. I am not in my body now. It is lifeless and dead, and numb to the touch. I am not even empty, i am just nothing.

I have no physical sensations in my body at all. Even if i am angry in my head, there is no physical response in my body to match lt.

My mind is always blank, on autopilot and numb.

By this I mean that my mind is really, really quiet. When I tried to meditate I don't experience much flow of thoughts at all. It's not the blissfully calm kind of quiet, but the mind-numbing kind. I just go with the flow and do a lot of things on autopilot. 

This has been wrecking my working experience (as a new grad). I have always done well with studying or clear mode of learning, but on-the-job training where I have to assess based on a lot of conditions wrecked me. My mind is not thinking at all whenever I'm doing my work tasks, no critical thinking, very low observational skills and bad judgment. I can spend hours talking to a person and not even notice what color of dress she's wearing, get lost on directions easily and don't observe when my colleagues are doing their tasks so I can pick up some pointers.

Worse still, I always make stupid mistakes because my mind is always numb and on autopilot. There's no inner monologue saying, ""Hang on, why are you putting that half drank glass of coffee on general waste basket where it can attract ants?""

Since I'm barely thinking throughout the day, I always misplace items and lost track of time. Also, if I made mistakes and get feedbacks on it, my mind will go into panic mode. I wouldn't be showing much physical responses (shaking, sweating etc), but my cognitive functions will be impaired even more and have a fear of failures and sense of impending doom, starting a chain reaction of further mistakes. 

I've been trying to force my mind to just think of something, anything, or to force myself to observe the surroundings and be attentive/mindful, but I can't keep it up the whole day and it doesn't help that much. 

Can it get better?

It feels sort of like imposter syndrome because I know that's not who I am underneath and I'm just presenting something outward so that I can keep a stable job and not have everything come crashing down on me.

Even after years of doing this the feeling has never gone away. I feel guilty after every successful social interaction and there's a small voice in the back of my mind that says ""You're such an awful person for tricking everyone. You don't really deserve to succeed in life because you lie constantly to every person you meet. One day they'll find out and no one will be sympathetic after they realize you've deceived them.""

I've tried to hide who I am at every job I've ever had and it always backfires on me because I internally shut down during confrontations but outwardly it looks like I'm about to hurt someone, or I otherwise come across as a jerk.

Self Reported Notes:

* **Sensory:**
   * Told by multiple optometrists that I have light sensitivity, used to have to stare at the ground walking around as a kid. I often make ‚Äúhand binoculars‚Äù to be able to see around during the day outside. I blink several times per second, which is very noticeable to other people, who often comment on it.
   * Sometimes my skin can be really sensitive to light and can ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the lights as if they are exerting pressure against my skin/body. General dislike of sunlight, used to wear jackets to act as a ‚Äúfull body umbrella‚Äù in elementary school.
   * Jumpiness in response to certain sounds (usually loud or high pitch), temperatures, any unexpected touch, and other sensory experiences; nobody else around reacts to these same stimuli 99% of the time and if they do it is not as dramatic or noticeable. (Friends noticed this around 6th grade)
   * I often get headaches having even the most light of pressure on/around the head, such as sunglasses, headbands, hats, beanies, etc. (occurs somewhat randomly, tied to how tired I am from doing things outside usually?)
   * Aversion being barefoot on most irregular surfaces, especially grass, rough sand/gravel, slimy wet surfaces, will go out of my way to try and avoid these.
   * Picky about certain foods and will typically become distressed or breakdown if they are not acceptable.
   * Able to tell easily when I‚Äôm getting sick and where it is in my body, able to notice swollen lymph nodes really easily.
* **Movement**
   * Stimming with objects since I was a baby, would hold them right in my face and make noises while shaking them. Did this with anything I could pick up as a kid, eventually by elementary school I was sort of daydreaming/imagining over the objects. I still like to do this for around 20 mins - 3 hours a day, though the movements are not strictly repetitive the scenarios I imagine are and sometimes I imagine the same things on loop for months every day. Desire is triggered by boredom, excitement, creative inspiration, stress, anxiety, etc. Stopped doing it in public around 4th grade. By middle school I was only using #2 pencils with very specific parameters such as color, tip sharpness, sharpening angle, eraser length & shape, and over pencil length. I also preferred to do this in the bathroom with the fan on, acting like a white noise or isolation room kind of, I always feel like I can truly relax while I'm in there. The urge decreases when company is over or I am on a trip, unless I have some familiarity with that bathroom already, such as in my grandparents house. *\[Thought it was maladaptive daydreaming but it's not really daydreaming, and I don't fit many of the experiences that most people have with it.\]*
   * Always doing some kind of repetitive action (especially when nervous/anxious being in new or uncomfortable situations), such as cracking joints, leg bounces, swaying, swinging arms around, slapping hands against hips, chewing the insides of the mouth (sometimes till bleeding without noticing).
   * I have to consciously think about how much to swing my arms while walking, often forgetting to do so.
   * Generally uncoordinated, poor at hand-eye coordination compared to others.
   * Not able to make ‚ÄúR‚Äù sounds properly when speaking until middle school.
   * I think better when walking, will often pace around in loops or figure 8s when thinking/ranting, also needing to use lots of arm gestures because it feels better.
   * Preference to eat things symmetrically inside my mouth.
* **Emotional/Social**
   * I feel like I need to have critical skills so that people will rely on me and like me, so much so that I may sabotage my close friends getting too close to my niche or I may take over things I feel I can do better while being in control, hosting game servers, communication servers, group chats, event planning, etc.
   * Very low social battery, feeling exhausted sometimes just going to the grocery store or doing basic errands. Social events or even phone calls can be severely draining, especially if socializing outside.
   * Often it feels like I get left out of conversations or groups when I‚Äôm a part of them, feeling like a spectator. Not sure how to interact with group dynamics, even with close friends. One new person in a group of all my close friends will make me feel like everyone is a stranger, usually won‚Äôt say much at all unless spoken to.
   * Did not feel like I fit in with other people, felt like an alien or robot (from at least 3rd grade on), thought something had to be wrong with me.
   * High social anxiety, I will be filled with dread if I know a scheduled social interaction is scheduled later that day, such as phone calls or appointments.
   * Will get panic attacks from having to do new/stressful things by myself, such as going to get a car oil change or deposit cash at the bank.
   * Hard time talking on the phone, is generally awkward and does not know how to end conversations instinctively.
   * Issues with empathy, not able to understand others and their emotions.
   * Feeling like I never had any emotions besides some occasional negative feelings. Not able to articulate how I feel to others.
   * Hard time making friends, difficulty gauging current relationship standing with others and their moods, don‚Äôt know how to keep things going naturally.
   * Hate small talk, rather would discuss topics of interest or big existential questions, tends to talk at people when interested in the conversation.
* **Learning**
   * Low relatable interests to many others as a kid outside of videogames/tv-shows, most interesting books were Eyewitness ones on science topics and ‚ÄúThe way things work‚Äù; I didn't really read fiction outside of popular humor stuff. More interested in things, ideas, places rather than people and relationships.
   * Both really good and bad memory, great at memorizing things effortlessly on topics/subjects that I enjoy, extreme difficult with everything else and even very basic things like phone numbers or how to tie shoes (didn't learn till \~3rd grade); but could recall the entire layouts of COD Zombies maps and draw them in detention since I never did my homework.
   * I am really good at taking tests and have always described my approach to school as ‚Äúmin-maxing‚Äù with regards to how I apply myself. I am very much a 20% effort for 80% result type of person.
   * Struggled with various basic things, never learned month order, multiplication tables, failed to learn to type on a keyboard ‚Äúproperly‚Äù, struggled to learn basic marching drills and responses in ROTC, somewhat poor name and face recall.
   * Numbers said a different way seem like different numbers or are confusing, such as 1-‚ÄùOh‚Äù-1 rather than 1-‚Äùzero‚Äù-1, especially problematic in phone numbers. 
   * Always had very good reading comprehension as noted from testing in elementary school. 
* **Functioning**
   * When I get a new obsession I focus all of my time on thinking and talking about it. I have a hard time trying to do other things and will get upset when interrupted. Usually lasts anywhere from a week to months of really intense focus, then usually something else comes up and I swap over; my friends have always known this about me. Recently I have noticed depression periods in between when these swap sometime, or maybe that‚Äôs what causes the interest to die down?
   * Easily overwhelmed when several options or things are present at once, hard time figuring out how to start tasks. Works better with explicit instructions.
   * Difficulty following verbal instructions, will often forget them if not interested. 
   * Not able to write or sometimes even think when others are speaking, difficulty taking notes.
   * Hard time forming habits or routines, especially with hygiene; often told that I need to stop wearing the same thing for too long.
   * Motivational issues, not being able to do things without feeling motivation to do them, really hard to force myself to do things. Same with attention for things I‚Äôm not interested in; hard time getting back on track when pulled away from tasks.
   * Will often forget what I'm doing mid-task (from homework to getting a glass of water), unless it's something I'm really interested in.
* N**on-conformity / others**
   * Unconventional style of dress from childhood throughout middle school, didn't really care when people made fun of appearance. (cape and tail in 5th grade, randomly would wear a suit, dressed like the Doctor almost every day in middle school)
   * I am quite queer: (transgender woman) (asexual) (biromantic)
   * Dislike rules and structures that I do not understand or agree with; distrust of most authority by default. 
   * Internal sense of justice and what is good, desire to be a good person.
   * Used to only eat few foods, literally only butter noodles, chicken strips, cheese pizza, milk, spaghetti, miso soup, tofu, green apples, and plain sandwiches till I was in like 6th grade. I also ate the same basic sandwich at school every day from 1st grade till 11th grade.

Antipsychotics even in low doses (like the 25mg of Seroquel I took last night) make me feel like I imagine a zombie feels. Also not interested in Depakote or its cousins (same). Hydroxyzine isn't very effective, either, I already have it as a prn. My doctor won't give me benzos because I have a substance use disorder. 

My Lithium level came back at 0.5 yesterday, I'm wondering if more Lithium would help (in addition to ASD I also have bipolar disorder).

Basically I'm looking for something that helps without affecting my thinking or emotional tone, or capacity to enjoy life, too much.

So, I have an old study book, intro to programming. Each chapter is structured: Info with Examples, then problems at end of chapter.

To study efficiently, should I:
1. Try to solve each exercise and problem, only reading content I don't know?
2. Read through each chapter sequentially, doing problems as I go?

Also, as someone who has difficulty studying consistently, what are some ways I can pace myself for consistent studying? I have the problem of trying to do too much or too little, either burning out or becoming bored.

I constantly feel like a nuisance to everyone I know, I am constantly verbally and emotionally abused by my roommate and I have no where to go, everyone hates my idea of a comfortable and enjoyable lifestyle so now I feel anxious and depressed all the time and thanks to much of my life I have a lot of internal ableism that I can't get over.

I find it so difficult these days to just be content and happy, I am always upset at myself over basically everything and I have no confidence to deal with anything. Words and non-criticism just absolutely destroy me and often cause meltdowns. I become very easily burned out mentally and physically in the jobs I worked in the past to the point where even working part-time it was hard to keep a job for more than a couple months and I am too stupid to work many different careers.

980,Anyone else struggle with feeling grief?,"['grief', 'feeling', 'struggle']","So I‚Äôve always just had a hard time actually feeling grief over the loss of a loved one, I tend to look at it more like it was that person‚Äôs time and occasionally I‚Äôll try and mirror the emotions I see others have. My dad has been in the hospital the last week because he has been feeling nauseated and lost like 40 pounds in a month, they found a lump on his liver during a CAT scan and did a biopsy on Monday. Today my mom called to let me know that my dad has stage IV liver cancer and that it probably originated in his stomach (they‚Äôre doing an endoscopy today) and if it‚Äôs aggressive they gave him 6 months, and if it‚Äôs not they estimate 1-2 years. 

Since this first happened I‚Äôve gone into my normal autopilot where I‚Äôm just like, this is what happens to our bodies, they tend to develop cancer, and have planned to fly back home for a month to help out with my dads concession business. But I don‚Äôt feel like sad really, more like ‚Äúhow can I help everyone else out so they need to think/worry about anything else.‚Äù 

I feel like I should feel grief and sad and it‚Äôs kinda worrying me that I don‚Äôt. I know in the past it‚Äôll take months sometimes years for someone‚Äôs death to really hit me and it never feels appropriate to grieve at that time because others have already done their grieving and have moved to the later stages. 

TLDR; I usually process grief at a much later time if at all, and I‚Äôm wondering if that happens with other people or if it‚Äôs a me thing.",wbeq51,6,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wbeq51/anyone_else_struggle_with_feeling_grief/

982,Are there people here who constantly feel passively suicidal where you just think about suicide without planning to act on it?,"['suicidal', 'suicide', 'constantly', 'passively', 'think']","WARNING: This post mentions suicide, if you're in a bad place mentally you probably shouldn't read this. If you're considering suicide please seek help by posting on  [r/suicidewatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch)

According to studies, people with aspergers are almost ten times as likely to attempt suicide then the general population, with a third of them having attempted suicide at least once in their life. The average life expectancy for people with aspergers around the world is roughly 20 years shorter then that of the general population with roughly 60 years.

This is a truly shocking statistic, but from my own experience it makes sense. I started feeling passively suicidal around 8 years ago early in highschool, probably in the 2nd year. I had regular thoughts about suicide and came up with ways I could do it without seriously considering it. Towards the end of high school and for some time after it I came quite close to it though. High school was extremely stressful for me and I had to retake 2 years. Towards the end of the 4th year (which was the 2nd last year) I started using amphetamines to get though school, on the last day just before the summer break I knew I couldn't take another year of this and dropped out of highschool. I got addicted to drugs, mainly sedatives and dissociatives and probably got close to overdosing on sedatives many times, but I didn't care. However a year after dropping out I managed to do the last year in another school which was only 8 hours per week and graduated. But it took me an extra semester because I had to go to a rehab clinic due to getting hooked on benzodiazepines and getting physically dependent on them.

I got much better in the clinic, but after 6 months I got hooked on benzos again, but I wasn't suicidal anymore. I stopped because my final exam was in 2 months and went through CT withdrawal in my bedroom. This was over two years ago, today I'm much better and my thoughts about suicide are much less frequent, only having a fleeting thought on really bad days. But the idea of having a long life still is not appealing to me, I don't wanna live till 80. I don't feel like I have enough energy left to live that long, life is so exhausting. Everyday things like brushing my teeth or showering take so much more effort for me then it takes for normal people, I have to force myself to do it every day.

I'm wondering how many people here might feel the same, I'm sure I'm not the only one. I hope this post is appropriate for this subreddit.

EDIT: The fact that this post almost made it to the top of the subreddit is actually quite alarming, I didn't expect to get that many replies on it. It just proves even more how awful our society is at including people with aspergers and providing help when they need it.",waia7p,651,246,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/waia7p/are_there_people_here_who_constantly_feel/
