0,Is being very mildly autistic a recipe for lifelong suffering?,"Cos it sure feels like it to me. 

Having mild Aspergers (mild even within the range of Aspergers) seems to put you in a kind of social no man's land. You're ""normal"" enough so that you appear like everyone else on the surface but ""autistic enough"" so prevent really being able to integrate socially. ""Normal enough"" to understand what is expected of you, but ""autistic enough"" to never be able to reach that standard. 

Most people you meet will treat you very slightly differently, in ways that seem innocuous but which over time add up to massively change the direction of your life for the worse. You'll be ignored,  mocked, overruled and rejected for things without any obvious explanation. You'll seem to have a very limited ability to make friends or have control over your social life. Sometimes it can be so subtle that you wonder if you're imagining it or if the same thing happens to everyone else. (These examples are from my life as you may have guessed.)

You would think that being ""mildly autistic"" would mean that the impact on your life is mild, especially compared to more obvious forms of Aspergers. But in my experience nothing could be further from the truth. It seems that being in just the right range of Aspergers will condemn you to a life of misery, loneliness, depression, confusion and frustration that would be avoided if you were not autistic at all OR more obviously autistic. 

I could be wrong about this of course. Maybe I'm attributing to Aspergers other stuff that is treatable, like depression. Maybe the social skills I require can be learned and I just need to try harder. But right now I feel like I'm fighting a losing battle with my own brain. I'm 28, turning 29 and despite years of masking and trying to figure people out and improve my social skills, it's like Im stuck in this purgatory that I can never escape from. I'm at a particularly low ebb at the moment, hence the depressing rant.

Anyway I just wanted to get that off my chest. Any thoughts are welcome.",wq4gt7,882,262,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wq4gt7/is_being_very_mildly_autistic_a_recipe_for/
1,I suspect some of our social challenges come from us being more conscious than others about fake/insincere interactions.,"General interactions with people seem to follow social protocols that involve a lot of pretence. People are so often performatively affectionate even when they don't like each other, and perhaps due to conditioning most people don't seem to feel hyperaware of or bothered by the hypocrisy of these instances.

I am acutely aware of every interaction in which I am forced by social rules to pretend and perform something I do not actually feel.

I suspect a lot of the words we commonly use to describe our autistic experience (feeling like an imposter, performing, playing a role, masking, etc.) aren't just descriptions of what autistics do. They're descriptions of what everyone does but is unbothered by. We feel the dissonance acutely and therefore look for the words to describe this extremely unsettling experience.

It's not necessarily that others do not mask; it's that having to mask hurts our sense of integrity.

(Of course I am aware that masking is sapping for other reasons as well, but I found my above-described epiphany about perception of honesty rather interesting.)

2,Are there people here who constantly feel passively suicidal where you just think about suicide without planning to act on it?,"WARNING: This post mentions suicide, if you're in a bad place mentally you probably shouldn't read this. If you're considering suicide please seek help by posting on  [r/suicidewatch](https://www.reddit.com/r/suicidewatch)

According to studies, people with aspergers are almost ten times as likely to attempt suicide then the general population, with a third of them having attempted suicide at least once in their life. The average life expectancy for people with aspergers around the world is roughly 20 years shorter then that of the general population with roughly 60 years.

This is a truly shocking statistic, but from my own experience it makes sense. I started feeling passively suicidal around 8 years ago early in highschool, probably in the 2nd year. I had regular thoughts about suicide and came up with ways I could do it without seriously considering it. Towards the end of high school and for some time after it I came quite close to it though. High school was extremely stressful for me and I had to retake 2 years. Towards the end of the 4th year (which was the 2nd last year) I started using amphetamines to get though school, on the last day just before the summer break I knew I couldn't take another year of this and dropped out of highschool. I got addicted to drugs, mainly sedatives and dissociatives and probably got close to overdosing on sedatives many times, but I didn't care. However a year after dropping out I managed to do the last year in another school which was only 8 hours per week and graduated. But it took me an extra semester because I had to go to a rehab clinic due to getting hooked on benzodiazepines and getting physically dependent on them.

I got much better in the clinic, but after 6 months I got hooked on benzos again, but I wasn't suicidal anymore. I stopped because my final exam was in 2 months and went through CT withdrawal in my bedroom. This was over two years ago, today I'm much better and my thoughts about suicide are much less frequent, only having a fleeting thought on really bad days. But the idea of having a long life still is not appealing to me, I don't wanna live till 80. I don't feel like I have enough energy left to live that long, life is so exhausting. Everyday things like brushing my teeth or showering take so much more effort for me then it takes for normal people, I have to force myself to do it every day.

I'm wondering how many people here might feel the same, I'm sure I'm not the only one. I hope this post is appropriate for this subreddit.

EDIT: The fact that this post almost made it to the top of the subreddit is actually quite alarming, I didn't expect to get that many replies on it. It just proves even more how awful our society is at including people with aspergers and providing help when they need it.",waia7p,656,246,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/waia7p/are_there_people_here_who_constantly_feel/
3,Anyone besides me get annoyed when someone tells you to stop saying “Aspergers”?,"It’s really frustrating that others want to correct me on how I choose to identify my autism.  I know the history.  I do not need nor want a lecture on it.  I have Aspergers.

7,Aspergers is a lifelong prison sentence to misunderstanding and not being appreciated,"Today a friend told me he didn't want my help with a project anymore. Basically I took too long and he's tired of waiting for me to get my shit together.

This is a pattern that repeats over and over in life, people just get tired of waiting for me / move on / tell me I'm doing it wrong there are 1000 variations but the end is that nobody is willing to wait for me and I have to do everything at everyone elses pace

Life is becoming not worth it anymore. I try and I try but my best is never enough and I can't keep up with the demands of adult life. I am a 37 year old man child and I'm on the brink of losing everything because I can't find any work better than $15/hr working at a fucking kayak store. I spent a decade doing software development and it feels like my career was a hallucination or something that somebody else did.

I cannot take the pressure anymore life is not worth living if all I can ever do is stress about not being good enough.

9,FLIRTING IS SO EASY NOW,"My fellow people, I have recently cracked the code to flirting. Many moons I have passed searching for the answer to flirting, reading the algorithms, learning the codes, and yet the answer was so much easier than one might have expected. 

There I am on a Friday night, analysing my good friend as he effortlessly pulls another girl’s number. As I sit there wondering “how does he do it?” He comes over and relieves my churning mind with a simple phrase, “it’s not what you say it’s how you say it”. There it was, the final piece, no, the only piece of the puzzle was complete. There I sat, with the key to success, as all the tangled knots came loose in my head.

11,Made the mistake of speaking up again.,"On another sub, I saw a video of a kid having a meltdown in response to being teased at school. It was without context, unless you took the title text for truth. (I'm not going to link it to prevent brigading.) This video hit me so hard, I immediately remembered what it was like to be in his shoes. It was so much like when I had been through. Of course somebody in the comments was like ""he's probably autistic"" and someone who knew confirmed it. I'm so sick of seeing that in the top of the comments every time a video like that shows up. I'm sick of people videoing autistic meltdowns and posting it for entertainment. I felt the need to speak up about it and tell my story and stick up for the kid. My comment is already getting 
""debated"" to hell, and lots of people in the thread are comparing him to that one annoying autistic kid they once knew ""to be fair"". I feel like an idiot whenever I open my mouth for more than a minute, no matter how much thought I put into what I say. I feel like whenever I talk about my experiences as an autistic person in any other space I just get ignored or blasted, because some random NT thinks they know better, so it's pointless.

19,"A friend spiked my drink with LSD, and I'm not sure how to react. It's taken a year for me to process what happened, but maybe it's not a big deal.","This was a guy I had known for a while but we weren't super close. Throughout knowing him he has occasionally tried to get me to drop acid with him. Now that I know I'm an Aspie, I'm a little worried about his (and others) motivation for this: like me on acid would be some sort of entertainment or oddity for them.  

Anyway, we hung out one night. He said he was going to drop some acid and asked if I wanted to join.  I've long noticed my brain is more sensitive to chemical stimulants, so I ALWAYS decline when offered because my brain clearly has a different reaction to substances. I can't assume that because others are safe taking it that I will be with my unique brain chemistry.

So he said fine. We were both drunk, it was cold out, and I vaguely remember him saying he would make some coffee. 

The next morning, when I was leaving out for work, I drink the hot coffee already sitting there (with the coffee maker ON). I drive down to work as I sip my coffee and get there safely. But I'm feeling off. I attributed it to being some weird hangover symptom as I began unlocking the building for the day. As I'm unlocking, it was like I became totally disoriented. In the building I've worked at for a year, I was suddenly lost. It was as if I was dreaming the way everything seemed obscured around me, but I was clearly awake and very scared.  I told my coworker I wasn't feeling well, and I just sat down right there on the floor. I'm not sure how she reacted, but given how people see us as weird, she probably didn't take it seriously as a potential emergency. it seems she thought I purposely did drugs before work. My coworker later came to me and asked if I was high that morning. 

I told her no, of course not, and that I was just feeling dehydrated from drinking last night.

I was confused and disoriented and clearly drugged. I'm honestly not sure how much time passed. But I came-to at some point and just went to my desk and tried to process what-the-fuck was happening. Later that day I met the same friend for lunch, and was still feeling a little off and probably mentioned that to him. He asked if I drank the coffee that morning. I said yes. He said nothing more, but did offer some facial expression that I remember wasn't what I'd expect over a regular pot of coffee. It took me weeks to make the connection

Some of my Aspergers symptoms got significantly worse around that time too, but that could be due to many other things like stress so IDK right now. 

I'm terrified that someone would do this to me. Even if drugging me wasn't on purpose, to not tell me what happened when you clearly know it was in the coffee? To do that to my body, even if it was accidental, and not let me know?

Never hast this ever happened to me before this or since.

IDK what to do. It feels serious and as an Aspie it terrifies me that someone would do that to me when I clearly don't have the same defenses and awareness that they do.

she said “hi” back with a weird frown on her face.

i said “i live just over there” and pointed to my house. “are u washin your car?”

“ya” she said

“cool…” i said.

a car drove by so i briefly stepped onto the sidewalk. when it passed i stepped back onto the road.

“do you like chocolate milk?” i asked (this is an icebreaker-question i frequently use).

she looked around. she looked behind herself. finally she said “if you dont leave im calling the police.”

…

dumbfounded, i replied “oh, um…. ok. sorry.” and walked away from her house

_on the way back to my house i talked to some other neighbors about a wooden planter they were building. that went a lot better._

29,I put on noise canceling headphones today and immediately cried,"After getting back from a three week solo trip, in which I was alone for the majority of it and went days without interacting with people, I threw myself back into social life. In the last few days, I’ve been to parties or seen friends every day. Going from the quiet of small towns in Italy and the relative peace of Berlin back to the chaos that is Brooklyn was a shock. I had a nice morning working in a garden, but when I went to my friends apartment, all of the sounds + the residual energy of all of the social time caused me to curl up into a ball on the couch and shut down. Three different songs were playing simultaneously at a block party outside. The scent of the detergent from my clean shirt felt like it was holding me captive. Time felt like it had slowed to a halt. I found myself unable to speak or move, even when I was asked if I was okay. I couldn’t figure out what was wrong, I felt an overwhelming emotion that was unidentifiable, like I needed something but didn’t know what it was. 

My friend left the room, then came back with a pair of noise canceling headphones and told me to see if they would help. They sat next to me while I put them on.

It’s one major goal in my big plan to push my life in the direction I want it to be in achieved. Next up in the fall it’ll be the release of my webcomic, then making my art website, and finally in the beginning of next year getting a car.

My reasoning goes like this. Most people would agree that the point of life is to be happy right? Well what is happiness? I know this is a super philosophical question and a very subjective one too but it's one that everybody who had ever lived needs to answer.

I think from what I gather from everyone I talked to, everywhere I look on the internet, and from my own personal experiences the key ingredient for happiness is RELATIONSHIPS.

Now IMAGINE being born with a rare disease where the core symptom is a lifelong struggle to form and maintain relationships. Another way to put it is if you DONT struggle with relationships then you DONT have this disorder.

I only had one shot at life and I cant believe i was one of the few selected to deal with this lifelong disorder.  I do understand there's people out there with BPD and schizophrenia and I think they may have a worst struggle than me but Autism comes in a close 3rd.

Why go on living a subpar life where your best attempt at happiness is most people's average attempt? Maybe I'm looking at this all wrong which is why I'm here.",w9scs9,251,398,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/w9scs9/tell_me_why_aspergers_isnt_one_of_the_worst_hands/

43,Family hid diagnosis for 27 years.,"I've written and deleted this so many times over the past few days, still not sure if I should post this or not.

Over this past weekend my family had a get together, most of them I have not seen in over a decade, some longer even. I have been planning on asking questions about my belief that I could possibly be autistic, for the weeks leading up to this I wrote down questions and rewrote and edited everything I planned to ask even asking my partner how to make things more subtle but direct enough that I could at least get the answers. The plan did not survive contact with my family.

Too many new faces and old faces that have changed, I completely blanked and went back into my old mode of trying to not be noticed. My partner would have none of it though. She dragged me off to see my grandfather who does not have long left, stage 4 cancer has changed him so much. 

It was as awkward as you can imagine, somewhere in the conversation he said ""I see you haven't grown out of the shyness yet, the doctors said you wouldn't"". I didn't really know what to respond besides asking which doctors.

I remember having to go to speech therapy and some behavioral therapy in the first year of school so that I could be 'on the same level' as my other class mates as I was younger than the rest of my peers as my birthday falls in the last part of the school year and generally those kids have to get evaluated or kept back a year. This was partially correct. Early the previous year (1994) I was evaluated to go to school and they picked up something, I was then referred to a specialist who then diagnosed me with Asperger's Syndrome (yes I know it is no longer called that, this is as it was told to me by my grandfather and later corroborated by other family and eventually my father when I confronted him), also with ADHD and Dyslexia.

My grandfather and grandmother were told that I had grown out of it and they were never to mention it, neither knew much and just figured it was another illness their constantly sick grandchildren had. My younger brother and I were in and out of hospital for various issues and hereditary faults so my parents were constantly stressed and in a lot of debt so once I seemed to have 'gotten better' they dropped the therapy and pretended that I had been cured. Yes this was a shock and made me angry. Here I was 27 years later at 33 looking for answers as to why my life was the way it was, I had come to find answers of sorts in RAAD-S, AQ, AQ-10, Aspie Quiz, etc. I had found answers in this community and others. None of the answers were official and I have been in and out of impostor syndrome while I kept looking more and more into it, spiraling and letting my work and relationship suffer as I delved deeper into Autism research and looking for someone in this backwards country to help me. Meantime my family had the answer, an official one. This was not the end though.

&#x200B;

I sought out conformation, my grandfather was old, sick, and gave no fucks. He could have been wrong. I directly spoke to my aunts and uncles. They hesitated at first and then confirmed that yes, I was diagnosed with Aspergers (Assburgers for some or that I was ""r-word once""). I was livid and turned to the one person responsible for me not knowing myself, for me not getting the help and support I need. My father.

&#x200B;

He confirmed it. It looked like I had 'gotten better', so they had stopped the therapy, they were scared I was going to be taken away so they had decided to pretend that I had never been diagnosed at all. Whenever the school came to them with sorry that I was different they covered it by reminding the school that I was younger than my peers and just had to catch up. 

My mother died suddenly in 1998. I remember it clearly, what followed not so much as I had retracted into myself and became almost nonverbal. I remember lots of different therapists. My dad told me that they all suspected Aspergers and wanted me referred for diagnosis, one even wanted to diagnose him. He moved me around in fear that I would be diagnosed again and taken away from him and put in a home. He could not have that, eventually he found someone that looked at money rather than the patient and I became a kid who was grief-stricken.

Time went on and I had many issues with learning and fitting in, at no time was my diagnosis disclosed, I was just shy and lazy and 'smart but does not want to put in the work'.

He never realised what Aspergers was or what I have been dealing with, he was too scared to lose me.

It has taken the last few days for me to overcome the anger, in my delving into Autism I have been suspecting that my father is also autistic, he was trying to do the best he could, it wasn't great and it wasn't always the right thing but he was suddenly alone and had 3 kids to take care of, 2 of whom were very sick physically. In some parts I blame him for never telling me, in others I sort of understand in an odd way.

&#x200B;

I am no longer just the weird guy, I am no longer a freak, I am no longer looking for a diagnosis or self diagnosing, I am an Aspie. In my country there are no accommodations and very little support for adults and it is ok, all I ever wanted was to know why I was broken. Now, finally I know I am not broken, just different. The relief of finally knowing is something I can not describe. I just wish it had come sooner, before the suicide attempts and burnouts, before all the jobs I lost and walked out on, I wish I had known who I was sooner. On the other hand I can't change the past, at least now I know that I am not crazy or a freak.

I don’t get it. How don’t they not enjoy the act of learning about their favourite interests? What are they driven by in life? Don’t they experience that same rush of dopamine asking and answering questions? What is their joy in life? What makes them not take their own lifes out of boredom?

There is diversity in Autism/Aspergers, we should be inclusive and respectful of one another.","I feel even though most people on this subreddit are autistic or aspies, we still need education about the spectrum and why we are different. I am very shocked at how some people in this subreddit treat others. 

Autism/Asperger's is a spectrum, some people are extremely affected or impaired and require more support than others The fact that you are doing well as an autistic individual doesn't mean everyone can apply what you did to be successful.

Edit: Invalidating other people's struggles and comparing ourselves to others without recognising differences is unhealthy.

Certain factors account for why people go through a lot more than others. It could be demographics, culture, religion, wealth,  educational background, gender, sexuality, parental upbringing, etc.
You may be diagnosed with only Aspergers/Autism, however, let us be respectful of other people on this platform who are heavily impaired by their Autism/Asperger or who have Autism/Aspergers coupled with other comorbidities(ADHD, OCD, BPD, Bipolar, schizophrenia, depression, dyslexia, other mental health disorders, personality disorders and illnesses).

Instead of feeling or thinking people here keep complaining and don't put in much effort, be grateful for where you are in life. Yeah, everyone struggles but let us not forget that some struggle more than others due to varying circumstances.

People come here to vent because they feel we can understand and empathise with them. Not everyone can understand or empathise but we can try to be respectful and kind. I feel instead of only mentioning our achievements and thinking people are not trying enough, let us talk about how autism affects us and give tips on how we overcame these obstacles to get to where we are in life. It will be best to ask questions than assume people are not trying enough.

51,Anyone else feel guilty after successful social interactions because it feels like you're LARPing as a NT person and you've made other people believe a lie about who you are?,"It has taken me literal decades to practice common social interactions and get to the point where I can pass as a NT person, at least for brief periods of time. It feels sort of like imposter syndrome because I know that's not who I am underneath and I'm just presenting something outward so that I can keep a stable job and not have everything come crashing down on me.

Even after years of doing this the feeling has never gone away. I feel guilty after every successful social interaction and there's a small voice in the back of my mind that says ""You're such an awful person for tricking everyone. You don't really deserve to succeed in life because you lie constantly to every person you meet. One day they'll find out and no one will be sympathetic after they realize you've deceived them.""

I've tried to hide who I am at every job I've ever had and it always backfires on me because I internally shut down during confrontations but outwardly it looks like I'm about to hurt someone, or I otherwise come across as a jerk.

At my most recent job, I tried to be casually upfront with coworkers that I'm on the spectrum so if I seem awkward, that's why.

It's unfair that I, and people like me, are always expected to accommodate others' preferred communication styles while people with more NT type styles are almost never willing to stretch themselves for us.

&#x200B;

It's been a running joke among my close friends and family that I'm 'withdrawn,' 'quiet,' or 'uninterested' in conversation. But last night, I had the epiphany that it's not me - it's the complete lack of effort of people around me.

Despite my reputation, I'm actually able to actively listen to someone talk about their favorite sport, celebrity gossip, or whatever drama they've recently imagined in their friend group, come up with a relevant reply, and carry on a short conversation. For obvious reasons, I keep those types of conversations short and I don't seek them out - but if that's your thing, we can carry on some small talk about it.

Last night, my wife was telling me about the latest gossip story she read on the news and summed up the story with her opinion that the person in question should be in jail. In this case, I actually knew a little about the underlying legal considerations (not much, but a little) so I took about 2 minutes to explain that, while the behavior in question was shitty, it wasn't illegal. Why a law against that activity would be essentially unenforceable. And that these types of situations are the reason we have civil law. I speculated that the wronged person had probably *already* sued and maybe even been awarded damages but the article that she read (which was obviously written to stir up anger) intentionally left that out to make the scenario seem as ridiculous and un-just as possible.

That whole explanation took only between one and two minutes. But when I finished, I could see that her eyes were glazed over and she had stopped listening or caring what I was talking about after about the first 10 seconds. She just said something non-commital like ""well, I just feel really bad for that person,"" and ended the conversation there.

Like, WTF, I listen to other people talk about stupid crap all day every day and I'm accused of being aloof or withdrawn because I'm not super excited about the local sportsball team or celebrity scandal. But when I want to talk in some *slight* depth about a topic *you* brought up, you're willing to expend exactly zero effort to think or participate in the conversation.

I'm definitely getting more comfortable with the fact that other people are the problem when it comes to communication and interpersonal connection.

Edit: Quick note to apologize that I""m being so vague about the topic of the article. It tangentially involved a notorious case of ""SWATting"" that occurred several years ago and resulted in a death. The exact details and circumstances were presented in such an intentionally politically charged way that it would derail the conversation.

56,“Autism a disorder of high intelligence” …. “Linked with too many cortical neurons” (another research post for those interested),"Okay, so cortical neurons are associated with intelligence with a positive correlation. Autistics have too many cortical neurons which *can* lead theoretically with slower processing or can lead to high intelligence. 

I almost certainly think it leads to synaptic overload. And the formation of too many neural connections. I think this explains our sensory overload response to stimulus. 

I think this also explains why the genes associated with autism are associated with high intelligence and why there are many autists with extremely high IQs at much larger proportions than NT populations. 

This is the stuff that interests me - the neural mapping and genetic differences we share as autistic folks 🙃

Editing to add: 

IQ is just one data point but not the only one. Lots of autistic people that would struggle to sit through a standard IQ test often have exceptional and skewed abilities and/or different ways or patterns of looking at the world that is remarkable. 

The point about IQ is because even though ASD is called a disability, a large proportion of us skew toward high IQ - an NT measure for fitness and intelligence. It fascinates me though it is not the most important or relevant thing.

I think it’s important to understand how our increase in cortical neurons relates back to all of this.

59,Does anyone else get a feeling at social events or concerts where they're really enjoying it but desperate to leave?,"I just got my diagnosis so still getting my head around this. I quit drinking during the pandemic which has made social situations and going to concerts kind of tricky. 

One thing I've noticed, especially with concerts, is if the band is playing for longer than about 45 minutes I start feeling like I'm antsy that they would finish, even though I'm really enjoying it. I had assumed it was a sign of depression but with my diagnosis I'm wondering if it's just my brain running out of steam for being out in public with a lot of stimulation going on (I mainly go to see pretty technical metal bands).

Anyone else experience this? I find the same sometimes now when at a restaurant with friends or similar.

62,Had a talk with a police officer after my ex reported me for “electronic harrassment” after breakup. He sympathized with my neurodivergence.,"So, long story short, this girl who thought we had a future together decides to ditch me in the middle of our sixth date and after trying to calmly have a talk in order to end things and find out what I could improve on in the future or with myself, she merely tells me she had a bad gut feeling and trusts it and then just ghosts me. I get anxious and impulsive and then send her texts where I calmly try to see if she will elaborate, and I try to save my reputation by affirming that I am in no way a threat. 

This makes me really sad and self-conscious. I tell her that I am on the spectrum, but I still get nothing. I know I should have left her alone but I am really bad at taking nonverbal cues as absolute. I was hoping that she would just tell me something so I could shut up and go away. But society treats this as “giving in to a manipulator”. I have my flaws, but I had no intention of manipulating and doing harm. 

After this passed, I felt so ashamed for reacting how I did and confirming her gut feeling about me (whatever that may be), so I thought I should try to salvage my bad deeds by apologizing a few weeks later. I never once pressured her to respond back. I just wanted to redeem myself and say “I messed up, just know that I’m not who you think I am” Still no response. This time she reports me to law enforcement.

An officer calls me and explains that I am not in trouble, but if I contact her again, I will violate the law. I understood and got really sad. He asked for my side of the story and I told him about how I am not good with these situations, how I am on the spectrum, and I never meant to be creepy. He understood and somewhat sympathized with me. He even told me that what she did on our date was not a nice thing and that this girl might not be as nice of a person as I think she is. He told her that what I did was not a crime. It sounded like she wanted to get me in trouble really badly. 

Now, I am not trying to use ASD as a justification for electronic harrassment. But, it seems like some neurotypical people are very ableist and think we are crazy psycopaths who will do harm. This hurts my feelings since I am a very timid person and would never commit a crime. Sometimes I struggle with understanding someone’s boundaries. This is why good communication needs to be taught more in autism awareness. I now feel really ashamed. I almost committed a crime when all I wanted was to save face, but I also felt so bad for freaking out this girl and just wanted to say sorry for being a weirdo. She made me feel like a creep from the start and I inadvertently acted like one. Lesson learned. I will ghost back when ghosted from now on. Thoughts? How can I rub off the feeling that I am a creep/stalker?",wqh7q3,181,104,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wqh7q3/had_a_talk_with_a_police_officer_after_my_ex/

67,Hardest Part of being Autistic?,"I wasn't professionally diagnosed until this year and I've begun to reframe the way others have treated me in the past. Doing so has made me realize that 99% of people whom I thought were giving me the time of day were actually taking advantage of me. 

The hardest part for me right now is accepting I will never get closure with most/all of these people. Before knowing I was autistic, people I thought were my friends would suddenly drop and ghost me. I'd be left with so much confusion without any explanation. Now that I'm aware of my disability, I have been asking for accommodations from family and my (ex) partner. 

I ended up going no-contact with my abusive family, so no closure there, and my partner of nearly 10 years broke up with me as soon as I started standing up for myself. I'm not getting any closure there either as he has already moved on (was cheating on me the whole time actually) and has no interest in talking to me, definitely not about disability or his manipulative actions.

When I didn't know I was autistic I suffered constant heartache and bullying I couldn't process until now. And since I've started working on my self-esteem and standing up for myself, setting boundaries, and pointing out abusive behavior I've lost every last social support.

Again, the worst part is not having any closure. These people's actions are baffling, and I can't move on with things that don't make sense. What's worse, I know that these people don't think they've done anything wrong, and most probably haven't thought of me since I stopped being useful to them. 

Every day I'm hit with realization after realization that I was being manipulated, bullied, abused. I feel at the same time so stupid/naive for not recognizing their intentions and furious that so many people see nothing wrong with the way they treat me as a disabled person. It's a lot of emotion to process on my own, on top of the fact that I can't support myself at this point in my life. I've never needed a ton of friends, but I can only imagine how much easier life would be to deal with if I had one ride-or-die to stand up for me.",wlq1qf,159,53,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wlq1qf/hardest_part_of_being_autistic/

73,"""To be yourself"" means to amuse the neurorypicals","There is this weird obfuscation in social media about ""being yourself"". This stupidity is being hammered into our heads harder than the ten commandments.

I managed to mask really well in highschool, unaware of my autism, and people considered me to be an authentic person. When I was 13 I developed an special interest for comedy and thanks to my therapist I could talk in public with some effort but nice results. I just had no apprehension for who was I approaching and I was basically a cleverbot irl with a witty phrase for everything. I was ""being myself"".

Now, in college, the lockdowns and online classes set my in a reset of social skills. I just got used to loneliness and it's pretty comfy for me. I no longer feel compelled to take part in something so draining, awkward  and unpleasent as socializing. I do not want to put so much energy in something that doesn't bring me anything at all. I just try say ""Hello"" back and not to stim to much in public. I'm, quite literally, being myself.

I sometimes can tell that people hate it. Some girls of my class looked at me with their eyes opened as if I was a serial killer when I asked them the date of an exam. People often think that I am on drugs. Most people, even the ones that deeply respected me once now act as if I didn't exist. At first it hurted but the energy that I'm getting back is just amazing.

They said that I didn't understand because I was autistic, but normal people get it, and I shouldn't break down conversations into what their words mean, that NT's just get the context and although the words they are using don't mean what they say they mean, neurotypicals get the idea.

I am used to this behaviour, I don't let it bother me; but, they kept on insisting that it was me that was the problem in the communication.

Eventually it turned out that what they meant ""was the origin of"" rather than ""brings"", which to me is a big difference.  For example, clouds bring water, but they are not the origin of said water.

I've read in some other subreddits of people talking with nerodivergent people saying that we get caught up on one point that doesn't matter and we should just leave it alone.

I feel like this may be both fair and unfair, the problem I see with just letting things go like that is that it has lead to miscommunications in the past. For example, I arranged to meet someone at our local college over email, they agreed and on the day of said they were in their way to the university.  I corrected them that I was at the college and they ended up going to the university and we didn't meet up.

It sucks when this happens, because I want to be a part, but every person has their ""this means that"" code in their brain that I don't know.

90,University of Cambridge research: Autistic individuals are more likely to be LGBTQ+,"https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-individuals-are-more-likely-to-be-lgbtq

“New research from the University of Cambridge suggests that autistic individuals are less likely to identify as heterosexual and more likely to identify with a diverse range of sexual orientations than non-autistic individuals.

The findings have important implications for the healthcare and support of autistic individuals. The results are published in the journal Autism Research.  

For many years it was wrongly assumed that autistic individuals are uninterested in sexual or romantic relationships, but this is not the case. In recent years, small studies have suggested that autistic individuals are more likely to experience a wider diversity of sexual orientations and are less likely to have sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, the existing evidence has been limited in size and scope.

In the largest study to date on these topics, the team at the Autism Research Centre used an anonymous, self-report survey to study the sexual activity, sexual orientation, and sexual health of autistic adults. Overall, 1,183 autistic and 1,203 non-autistic adolescents and adults (aged 16-90 years) provided information about their sexual activity, sexual orientation, and medical history of STIs.

The results showed that the majority of autistic adults (70% of autistic males and 76% of autistic females) engage in sexual activity—although they do so to a lesser degree than their non-autistic peers (89% of both non-autistic males and females report engaging in sexual activity). In contrast to previous findings, the results also found that there were no differences in likelihood of ever contracting an STI, or the age at which participants first engaged in sexual activity, between autistic and non-autistic individuals.

In addition, the study found that autistic adults and adolescents are approximately eight times more likely to identify as asexual and ‘other’ sexuality than their non-autistic peers. And there were sex differences in sexual orientation: **autistic males are 3.5 times more likely to identify as bisexual than non-autistic males, whereas autistic females are three times more likely to identify as homosexual than non-autistic females.**

When comparing autistic females and males directly, autistic females were more likely to be sexually active; more likely to identify as asexual, bisexual, and ‘other’ sexuality; and were less likely to identify as heterosexual.

Elizabeth Weir, a PhD candidate at the Autism Research Centre in Cambridge, and the lead researcher of the study, said: “Understanding the intersectional identities of autistic individuals who are asexual, bisexual, homosexual, or ‘other’ sexuality is key. It is particularly important that healthcare providers and educators use language that is affirming and accepting of all sexual orientations and gender identities when providing sexual education and sexual health screening checks to autistic and non-autistic people alike.” 

Dr Carrie Allison, Director of Strategy at the Autism Research Centre and a member of the team, said: “We must ensure that autistic individuals are receiving equal access to healthcare and support in their choices in their personal lives, to enjoy fulfilling lives and good mental health.”

Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, Director of the Autism Research Centre and a member of the team, said: “This new study is an important example of applied health research with policy relevance for health and social care services.”",wkemwz,104,50,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/wkemwz/university_of_cambridge_research_autistic/

I’ve been more playful and flirty with him not too much because we are at work lmaoo and it’s a big reason why I’ve been so hesitant.

I used to read like crazy. I had a wall that was lined with books. Not a shelf, but a wall that was piled up so high that it touched the ceiling simply because I ran out of space to hold them. 

When I play games I have a very limited amount of time until I get bored. Nowhere near the hours I could spend when I was younger. If I’m lucky I can pull 20 minutes…

Honestly I barely have special interests, as a kid I could name every subspecies of beetle, I could tell you quite literally every dinosaur, pterosaur and ichthyosaur, when they lived and where… But now, I can barely muster the passion to get out of bed.
